# ETL

`loom.etl` is a declarative ETL subsystem with compile-time validation,
backend-agnostic declarations, and a single runtime entrypoint (`ETLRunner`).

## Install

Choose one backend:

```bash
pip install "loom-kernel[etl-polars]"
# or
pip install "loom-kernel[etl-spark]"
```

## Minimal pipeline

```python
from datetime import date

import polars as pl
from loom.etl import (
    ETLParams,
    ETLStep,
    ETLProcess,
    ETLPipeline,
    ETLRunner,
    FromTable,
    IntoTable,
)


class DailyParams(ETLParams):
    run_date: date


class CleanOrders(ETLStep[DailyParams]):
    orders = FromTable("raw.orders").columns("id", "amount", "run_date")
    target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace()

    def execute(self, params: DailyParams, *, orders: pl.LazyFrame) -> pl.LazyFrame:
        return orders.filter(pl.col("amount") > 0)


class DailyProcess(ETLProcess[DailyParams]):
    steps = [CleanOrders]


class DailyPipeline(ETLPipeline[DailyParams]):
    processes = [DailyProcess]


runner = ETLRunner.from_dict(
    storage={
        "engine": "polars",
        "defaults": {"table_path": {"uri": "/var/lib/loom/lake"}},
    }
)
runner.run(DailyPipeline, DailyParams(run_date=date(2026, 3, 30)))
```

## File source with JSON payload + final CSV report

```python
import polars as pl
from loom.etl import ETLStep, ETLProcess, ETLPipeline, FromFile, FromTable, IntoFile, IntoTable, Format

class Payload:
    store: str
    amount: float
    items: int

class LoadEvents(ETLStep[DailyParams]):
    events = FromFile("/data/raw/events.csv", format=Format.CSV).parse_json("payload", Payload)
    target = IntoTable("staging.events").replace()

    def execute(self, params: DailyParams, *, events: pl.LazyFrame) -> pl.LazyFrame:
        return events.select(
            pl.col("payload").struct.field("store").alias("store"),
            pl.col("payload").struct.field("amount").alias("amount"),
            pl.col("payload").struct.field("items").alias("items"),
        )

class BuildReport(ETLStep[DailyParams]):
    events = FromTable("staging.events")
    target = IntoFile("/data/exports/daily_report.csv", format=Format.CSV)

    def execute(self, params: DailyParams, *, events: pl.LazyFrame) -> pl.LazyFrame:
        return events.group_by("store").agg(
            pl.col("amount").sum().alias("gross_amount"),
            pl.col("items").sum().alias("item_count"),
        )

class ReportProcess(ETLProcess[DailyParams]):
    steps = [LoadEvents, BuildReport]

class ReportPipeline(ETLPipeline[DailyParams]):
    processes = [ReportProcess]
```

## File aliases (FileLocator)

Hard-coding file paths in pipelines couples the logic to the infrastructure.
Use `FromFile.alias()` / `IntoFile.alias()` to declare a **logical name** and
resolve it at runtime through the storage config.

Declare aliases in the `storage.files` block:

```yaml
storage:
  engine: polars
  files:
    - name: events_raw
      path:
        uri: s3://raw-bucket/events/
        storage_options:
          AWS_REGION: eu-west-1
    - name: exports_daily
      path:
        uri: s3://exports-bucket/daily/
```

Reference them in pipelines using the alias API:

```python
from loom.etl import ETLStep, FromFile, IntoFile, Format

class LoadEvents(ETLStep[DailyParams]):
    events = FromFile.alias("events_raw", format=Format.CSV)
    target = IntoFile.alias("exports_daily", format=Format.PARQUET)

    def execute(self, params: DailyParams, *, events: pl.LazyFrame) -> pl.LazyFrame:
        return events
```

The runner resolves aliases to physical URIs at job startup —
pipelines never hard-code storage paths or credentials.

You can also implement `FileLocator` directly for custom routing strategies:

```python
from loom.etl.storage import FileLocator, FileLocation

class MyFileLocator:
    def locate(self, name: str) -> FileLocation:
        return FileLocation(uri_template=f"s3://my-bucket/{name}/")
```

---

## YAML config (Polars path)

```yaml
storage:
  engine: polars

  defaults:
    table_path:
      uri: s3://my-lake
      storage_options:
        AWS_REGION: ${oc.env:AWS_REGION}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${oc.env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${oc.env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

  tmp_root: /var/lib/loom/lake/_tmp

observability:
  log:
    enabled: true
  otel:
    enabled: false
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    pushgateway_url: ${oc.env:PUSHGATEWAY_URL,http://127.0.0.1:9091}
  lineage:
    enabled: true
    # Choose exactly one destination:
    root: /var/lib/loom/lake/_runs
    # database: ops
```

```python
from loom.etl import ETLRunner

runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml("config/etl.yaml")
```

## Write modes

Every `IntoTable` target declares exactly one write mode by chaining a method.

### append

Adds rows to the table. Creates the table on first write.

```python
target = IntoTable("staging.orders").append()
```

### replace

Full overwrite. Replaces all data in the table.

```python
target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace()
# Overwrite schema too:
target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace(schema=SchemaMode.OVERWRITE)
```

### replace\_partitions

Replaces only the partitions **present in the batch**. The writer collects
the distinct partition values from the frame at write time — no params required.

```python
target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace_partitions("year", "month")
```

Use this for incremental loads where the batch carries its own partition identity
(e.g. daily runs writing the day's data).

### replace\_partition

Replaces a **specific partition** whose values come from run params. Resolves
the equality predicate at runtime without collecting from the frame.

```python
from loom.etl import params

target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace_partition(
    year=params.run_date.year,
    month=params.run_date.month,
)
```

Use this when the partition to replace is known at pipeline design time (e.g.
reprocessing a single day).

**Difference from `replace_partitions`:**

| | `replace_partitions` | `replace_partition` |
|---|---|---|
| Partition values | Collected from frame | Resolved from params |
| Collect step | Yes (distinct) | No |
| Use case | Batch carries its partition | Reprocessing a known partition |

### replace\_where

Replaces rows matching an arbitrary predicate. Accepts the full predicate DSL.

```python
target = IntoTable("staging.orders").replace_where(
    col("date").between(params.start_date, params.end_date)
)
```

### upsert

MERGE on key columns. Inserts new rows and updates existing ones.

```python
target = IntoTable("events.orders").upsert(
    keys=("order_id",),
    partition_cols=("year", "month"),  # strongly recommended for large tables
    exclude=("created_at",),           # columns excluded from UPDATE SET
)
```

`partition_cols` is optional but strongly recommended — without it every MERGE
forces a full table scan.

### update

Matched-only MERGE. Rows whose keys match are updated; source rows without a
match are ignored — nothing is ever inserted. Use it when an insert would be
a bug, e.g. repairing columns of an existing table. The target table must
already exist: a missing table is a write error, not a create.

```python
target = IntoTable("events.orders").update(
    keys=("order_id",),
    partition_cols=("year", "month"),  # strongly recommended for large tables
    include=("status",),               # only these columns are updated
)
```

### historify

For SCD Type 2 history tracking use `IntoHistory` instead of `IntoTable`.
See the dedicated [Historify](#historify) section below for full examples,
SNAPSHOT vs LOG mode, and configuration of boundary columns.

| Target | Use case | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `IntoTable(...).append()` | Add rows | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).replace()` | Full overwrite | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).replace_partitions(...)` | Replace batch partitions | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).replace_partition(...)` | Replace known partition | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).replace_where(...)` | Predicate-based overwrite | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).upsert(...)` | Merge by key | Above |
| `IntoTable(...).update(...)` | Update matches only, never insert | Above |
| `IntoHistory(...)` | SCD Type 2 historification | [Below](#historify) |

---

## Historify

SCD Type 2 historification tracks how entity states change over time by creating
a new row for every meaningful change and closing the previous open row.

```python
from loom.etl import IntoHistory, params

target = IntoHistory(
    "wh.dim_players",
    keys=("player_id",),
    track=("team_id",),
    effective_date=params.run_date,
)
```

### Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ref` | — | Logical Delta table reference |
| `keys` | — | Entity identity columns (e.g. `("player_id",)`) |
| `track` | `None` | Columns whose change triggers a new history row. `None` means all non-key columns |
| `effective_date` | — | `ParamExpr` for SNAPSHOT mode, or column name for LOG mode |
| `mode` | `"snapshot"` | `"snapshot"` (full state) or `"log"` (event stream) |
| `valid_from` | `"valid_from"` | Period-start boundary column |
| `valid_to` | `"valid_to"` | Period-end boundary column (`NULL` = open) |
| `deleted_at` | `"deleted_at"` | Soft-delete audit column (only written when `delete_policy="soft_delete"`) |
| `delete_policy` | `"close"` | `"ignore"` / `"close"` / `"soft_delete"` |
| `partition_scope` | `None` | Partition columns for read/write pruning |
| `allow_temporal_rerun` | `False` | Allow backfills with past `effective_date` |

### SNAPSHOT mode example

In SNAPSHOT mode the incoming frame represents the full current state of the
dimension. The engine compares it against the existing open vectors and inserts
new rows only for changed states.

**Day 1 incoming snapshot**

| player_id | team_id |
|---|---|
| 1 | RM |

**Result after historify**

| player_id | team_id | valid_from | valid_to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | RM | 2024-01-01 | `NULL` |

**Day 2 incoming snapshot (player changed team)**

| player_id | team_id |
|---|---|
| 1 | BCA |

**Result after historify**

| player_id | team_id | valid_from | valid_to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | RM | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 |
| 1 | BCA | 2024-01-02 | `NULL` |

The old row was closed (`valid_to = effective_date - 1`) and the new row was
opened.

### LOG mode example

In LOG mode the incoming frame is an event stream. Each event carries its own
`effective_date` column.

```python
target = IntoHistory(
    "wh.dim_subscriptions",
    keys=("subscription_id",),
    track=("plan",),
    effective_date="event_date",
    mode="log",
)
```

**Incoming event log**

| subscription_id | plan | event_date |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | basic | 2024-01-01 |
| 1 | pro | 2024-06-01 |

**Result after historify**

| subscription_id | plan | valid_from | valid_to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | basic | 2024-01-01 | 2024-05-31 |
| 1 | pro | 2024-06-01 | `NULL` |

The first event is automatically closed by the second one. The last event
remains open.

### Custom boundary column names

If your data warehouse uses different naming conventions, the three generated
columns are fully configurable:

```python
target = IntoHistory(
    "wh.dim_players",
    keys=("player_id",),
    track=("team_id",),
    effective_date=params.run_date,
    valid_from="vf",
    valid_to="vt",
    deleted_at="removed_at",
)
```

---

## Running only selected stages

Use `include` with process or step class names:

```python
runner.run(
    DailyPipeline,
    DailyParams(run_date=date(2026, 3, 30)),
    include=["DailyProcess", "CleanOrders"],
)
```

If no name matches, `InvalidStageError` is raised.

## Spark runtime

For Databricks/Unity Catalog runtime:

```python
from loom.etl import ETLRunner

runner = ETLRunner.from_spark(spark)
```

This wires Spark reader/writer/catalog automatically.

## Testing ETL steps

Use the built-in test harnesses:

- `loom.etl.testing.PolarsStepRunner`
- `loom.etl.testing.spark.SparkStepRunner`
- `loom.etl.testing.ETLScenario`

These let you seed source tables, run one step in isolation, and assert output
without wiring full storage infrastructure.

## File aliases (FileLocator)

Hard-coding file paths in pipelines couples the logic to the infrastructure.
Use `FromFile.alias()` / `IntoFile.alias()` to declare a **logical name** and
resolve it at runtime through the storage config.

Declare aliases in the `storage.files` block:

```yaml
storage:
  engine: polars
  files:
    - name: events_raw
      path:
        uri: s3://raw-bucket/events/
        storage_options:
          AWS_REGION: eu-west-1
    - name: exports_daily
      path:
        uri: s3://exports-bucket/daily/
```

Reference them in pipelines:

```python
from loom.etl import ETLStep, FromFile, IntoFile, Format

class LoadEvents(ETLStep[DailyParams]):
    events = FromFile.alias("events_raw", format=Format.CSV)
    target = IntoFile.alias("exports_daily", format=Format.PARQUET)

    def execute(self, params: DailyParams, *, events: pl.LazyFrame) -> pl.LazyFrame:
        return events
```

The runner resolves aliases to physical URIs at job startup — pipelines never
hard-code storage paths or credentials.

You can also implement the `FileLocator` protocol directly for custom routing:

```python
from loom.etl.storage import FileLocator, FileLocation

class MyFileLocator:
    def locate(self, name: str) -> FileLocation:
        return FileLocation(uri_template=f"s3://my-bucket/{name}/")
```

---

## Loading config from cloud storage

`ETLRunner.from_yaml()` accepts cloud URIs (`s3://`, `gs://`, `abfss://`, `r2://`, …)
in addition to local paths. Files are fetched via `fsspec` at startup:

```python
runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml("s3://my-bucket/config/etl.yaml")
```

`fsspec` is an extra and is only imported for cloud paths; a configuration kept on
local disk, includes and globs included, loads without it.

### Composing files with `includes`

A file may declare a top-level `includes` list. Entries load first, in order, and
the declaring file's own keys merge on top. Includes work on any scheme:

```yaml
# s3://my-bucket/config/etl.yaml
includes:
  - common.yaml            # relative to the including file, on any scheme
  - tables/*.yaml          # glob, matches merged in lexicographic order
  - /etc/loom/site.yaml    # absolute local path; schemes may be mixed
```

- Relative entries resolve against the including file; entries with a scheme or an
  absolute path are used as is, so local and cloud files may include each other.
- Globs expand through the standard library locally and through `fsspec` on cloud
  URIs; only regular `.yaml` / `.yml` files match, sorted by resolved path.
- An entry (plain or glob) that matches no file raises `ConfigError` naming the
  entry and the declaring file. Circular includes raise `ConfigError` too.

`ETLRunner.from_yaml()` takes one file; explicit layering of several files
(`load_config("base.yaml", "prod.yaml")`, later overriding earlier) is available on
`load_config` and `ConfigContext.from_yaml`.

---

## Splitting the storage config across files

`storage.tables` and `storage.files` are lists in the examples above. A list cannot
be split across files: OmegaConf replaces a list wholesale when it merges, so only
the last included file's tables would survive. Three YAML additions make a split
layout safe.

### Tables and files as a mapping keyed by name

Both collections also accept a **mapping keyed by logical name**. The key becomes
the route's `name`; the value holds the remaining fields (`ref` / `catalog` or
`path`). Mapping form and list form bind to the same `TableRoute` / `FileRoute`
values:

```yaml
storage:
  tables:
    orders.header:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/orders/header
    orders.line:
      ref: sales.orders_line
      catalog: main
  files:
    orders.export:
      path:
        uri: s3://exports/orders/
        storage_options:
          AWS_REGION: eu-west-1
```

Within an `includes` composition mappings merge **by key**, so `tables/orders.yaml`
and `tables/billing.yaml` contribute to one collection. The loader guards the merge:

- the same name declared in two included files is a `ConfigError` naming the key and
  both files (`storage.tables['orders.header'] is declared in '.../billing.yaml' and
  in '.../orders.yaml'`); a duplicate is never resolved by "last wins";
- list form in one file and mapping form in another is a `ConfigError`; use one form
  within a composition;
- files passed explicitly as layers (`load_config("base.yaml", "prod.yaml")`) still
  override by key, as explicit layering always has;
- the list form is unchanged, including its duplicate-name validation.

### Storage profiles

YAML anchors do not cross file boundaries. `storage.profiles` declares named,
partial `path:` settings once, in any file of the composition, and each route
refers to one with `profile:` inside its `path:` block:

```yaml
storage:
  profiles:
    standard:
      writer:
        compression: ZSTD
      target_file_size: 134217728
      commit:
        custom_metadata:
          team: billing
    large:
      writer:
        compression: ZSTD
      target_file_size: 536870912
      delta_config:
        delta.logRetentionDuration: interval 30 days
      storage_options:
        AWS_REGION: eu-west-1

  defaults:
    table_path:
      uri: s3://lake
      profile: standard

  tables:
    billing.invoice:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/billing/invoice
        profile: large
    billing.ledger:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/billing/ledger
        profile: large
        target_file_size: 268435456   # own field wins over the profile's

  files:
    billing.statement:
      path:
        uri: s3://exports/billing/statements/
        profile: large                # file routes take storage_options only
```

How a profile is applied:

- A profile may set `storage_options`, `writer`, `target_file_size`, `delta_config`
  and `commit`. It never carries `uri`; a profile with `uri` or any other field is
  rejected naming the field.
- `profile:` is accepted in the `path:` block of a table route, a file route and
  `storage.defaults.table_path`. It is consumed while the YAML is normalised and
  never reaches `TablePathConfig` / `FilePathConfig`.
- Resolution is **per field, replace not merge**: a field the route sets itself
  replaces the profile's field entirely (there is no key-level merge inside
  `writer`, `commit`, `delta_config` or `storage_options`); every other field
  comes from the profile.
- A file route takes only `storage_options` from its profile; the other fields are
  ignored, never rejected.
- An unknown profile name is a `ValueError` naming the route
  (`storage.tables['billing.invoice'].path.profile='huge' is not defined in
  storage.profiles`).

Profiles resolve when the `StorageConfig` is built through `ETLRunner.from_yaml` or
`ETLRunner.from_dict`; building the structs directly in Python does not apply them.

### Split layout example

```text
config/
├── storage.yaml          # entry point
├── common.yaml           # engine, defaults, profiles, catalogs
└── tables/
    ├── billing.yaml
    └── orders.yaml
```

```yaml
# config/storage.yaml
includes:
  - common.yaml
  - tables/*.yaml

observability:
  log:
    enabled: true
```

```yaml
# config/common.yaml
storage:
  engine: polars
  profiles:
    standard:
      writer:
        compression: ZSTD
      target_file_size: 134217728
  defaults:
    table_path:
      uri: s3://lake
      profile: standard
      storage_options:
        AWS_REGION: ${oc.env:AWS_REGION}
```

```yaml
# config/tables/orders.yaml
storage:
  tables:
    orders.header:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/orders/header
        profile: standard
    orders.line:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/orders/line
        profile: standard
```

```yaml
# config/tables/billing.yaml
storage:
  tables:
    billing.invoice:
      path:
        uri: s3://lake/billing/invoice
        profile: standard
  files:
    billing.statement:
      path:
        uri: s3://exports/billing/statements/
```

```python
from loom.etl import ETLRunner

runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml("config/storage.yaml")
# or, once uploaded: ETLRunner.from_yaml("s3://my-bucket/config/storage.yaml")
```

Removing `orders.line` from `orders.yaml` removes exactly that table; declaring it
again in `billing.yaml` fails at load with both file names in the message.

### Which entry points check duplicates

The by-key merge and its duplicate check are driven by the `keyed=` parameter of
`load_config` and `ConfigContext.from_yaml`. `ETLRunner.from_yaml()` passes
`loom.etl.storage.STORAGE_KEYED_COLLECTIONS`
(`"storage.tables"`, `"storage.files"`, `"storage.profiles"`). Other consumers that
want the same guarantees must pass it themselves:

```python
from loom.core.config import ConfigContext
from loom.etl.storage import STORAGE_KEYED_COLLECTIONS

ctx = ConfigContext.from_yaml("config/storage.yaml", keyed=STORAGE_KEYED_COLLECTIONS)
```

An entry point that loads the same file **without** `keyed=` (today, a REST or
Celery app built with `create_app`) merges `storage.tables` and friends with
OmegaConf's default deep merge: the last included file wins silently and no
duplicate is reported. Keep this in mind when one YAML tree is shared between an
ETL and an application.

---

## Pluggable config resolvers

`${prefix:key}` placeholders in YAML are filled in at parse time by *resolvers*.
loom ships two, backed by AWS: `secrets` (Secrets Manager) and `ssm` (SSM
Parameter Store). `ETLRunner.from_yaml` registers both by default, so a project
booted through the factory reads a secret with no code beyond the factory call:

```yaml
# config/etl.yaml
storage:
  catalogs:
    main:
      token: ${secrets:/prod/lakehouse/token}
      workspace: ${ssm:/prod/lakehouse/workspace}
```

```python
from loom.etl import ETLRunner

runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml("config/etl.yaml")
```

The built-in resolvers use boto3's default region and credential chain (the
environment, an instance or task role, `~/.aws/config`). Nothing talks to AWS
until a placeholder actually resolves: a YAML without `${secrets:...}` or
`${ssm:...}` never creates a client and boots without boto3 installed. When a
placeholder does resolve and boto3 is missing, the error names the extra to
install, `loom-kernel[config-ssm]`.

Resolvers run at job startup — secret rotation takes effect on the next run
without redeployment. Values are fetched once per loaded config object
(OmegaConf caches resolver results), so a rotated secret is seen on the next
boot, not mid-run.

### Your own resolvers

Pass `resolvers=` to add custom prefixes (Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, …).
A resolver is any object with a `name` and a `resolve(key) -> object`:

```python
from loom.etl import ETLRunner

class VaultResolver:
    name = "vault"

    def __init__(self, url: str) -> None:
        self._url = url

    def resolve(self, key: str) -> str:
        return read_vault_secret(self._url, key)

runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml(
    "config/etl.yaml",
    resolvers=[VaultResolver("https://vault.internal")],
)
```

```yaml
storage:
  catalogs:
    main:
      token: ${vault:kv/prod/lakehouse/token}
```

Precedence is by name:

- A resolver you pass with the same name as a built-in (`secrets`, `ssm`) is
  the one used. Pin a region that way instead of relying on the default chain:

  ```python
  from loom.core.config.ssm import SsmResolver

  runner = ETLRunner.from_yaml("config/etl.yaml", resolvers=[SsmResolver(region="eu-west-1")])
  ```

- A built-in default never replaces a resolver already registered in the
  process, whether by an earlier factory call or by `load_config`. Calling the
  factory repeatedly in one process is safe.
- Resolvers passed explicitly, to a factory or to `load_config`, replace an
  earlier registration of the same name.

`load_config` itself registers no defaults. When you load YAML by hand, pass
the resolvers you need; `default_resolvers()` returns loom's built-ins:

```python
from loom.core.config import default_resolvers, load_config

cfg = load_config("config/etl.yaml", resolvers=default_resolvers())
```

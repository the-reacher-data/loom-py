"""A cancellation after a commit must not strand a queued invalidation.

Before the transaction deferral existed, a bump was durable the instant the
wrapped write returned. Once bumps are queued and drained after the commit,
a cancellation landing between "commit returned" and "the drain finished"
would abort the drain and leave its remaining actions queued on a local
``channel`` variable nobody ever drains again — a committed write that
silently loses its cache invalidation. The channel's priority lane
(``enqueue_priority``, what ``CachedRepository`` queues its own bump
through) runs shielded inside :meth:`PostCommitChannel.drain` so this
cannot occur.

The plain lane (``enqueue``, what job dispatches use) is deliberately left
as cancellable as before: shielding it would make an inline job body — a
full nested use-case execution with no framework-imposed timeout —
uncancellable for as long as it ran. The second test below pins that this
lane's cancellability was not accidentally widened by the priority lane's
shield.

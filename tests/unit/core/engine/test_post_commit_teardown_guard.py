"""A teardown failure after a commit must not discard the queued invalidations.

``_run_in_unit_of_work`` resets the ``_active_uow`` contextvar token in its
``finally``, after the commit has already returned.  If that reset raises —
a token created in a different context, in principle — the exception used
to propagate straight into ``_run_lifecycle``'s ``except BaseException``,
which called ``channel.discard()`` unconditionally: a write that had just
committed lost every queued invalidation to an unrelated bookkeeping
failure.  ``_ExecutionState.committed`` closes this: once set, the handler
drains instead of discarding, and only logs a further drain failure so the
teardown error is what actually propagates.

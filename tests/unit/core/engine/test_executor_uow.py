"""Executor unit-of-work shapes the adapter contract suite cannot express.

``tests/unit/core/engine/contract`` runs every lifecycle scenario against the
real adapters, always with a ``uow_factory`` and with ``read_only`` passed at
the call site.  Two shapes stay here:

- an executor built **without** a factory at all;
- a use case declaring ``read_only`` on the class, so the plan carries it.

FR-015: the pins on ``flush_pending_dispatches`` / ``clear_pending_dispatches``
being called by the executor were replaced by observed dispatches, since the
executor now drains its own post-commit channel and no longer imports the job
context helpers.  The executor-level double-cancellation test was removed: the
cancellation shield moved into the adapters (lead decision 11), and the
behaviour is pinned by
``tests/unit/core/uow/test_sqlalchemy_uow.py::test_second_cancellation_during_rollback_still_rolls_back_and_closes``
and
``tests/unit/core/repository/mongo/test_uow.py::TestTransactional::test_second_cancellation_during_abort_still_aborts_and_ends``.

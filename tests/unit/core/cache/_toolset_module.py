"""Toolset classes as an artifact's own module writes them, for AC12.

They live in a real module, imported normally, because
``from __future__ import annotations`` is what the whole test turns on: every
annotation below is a string only *this* module's globals resolve, while a
wrapper built inside ``loom.core.cache.calls`` carries that module's globals
instead. A class defined inside a test function, or one built by ``exec``,
would not reproduce that.

"""Unit tests for ``GenerationalDependencyResolver.bump_from_events``.

The counters are bumped concurrently rather than one round trip at a time
(see ``dependency.py`` for the rationale), so these tests pin down the set of
keys touched rather than the calling order, which concurrent execution does
not guarantee.

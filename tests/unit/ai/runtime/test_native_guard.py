"""``AgentRuntime.native``'s guard: the chain and admission a hand-driven run may rejoin.

A run driven through ``AgentHandle.native()`` pushes nothing onto loom's own
call chain and takes no admission permit on its own — that is left to the
caller, through the zero-argument guard factory ``native()`` hands back on
the object it returns. These tests exercise that guard directly, against a
stub engine, so the cycle, depth and admission bounds it enforces are pinned
independently of any one engine adapter.

"""Build-time refusal when a capability keeps streaming despite ``streaming: false``.

``AgentRun.next`` streams a node whenever the run's root capability overrides
``wrap_run_event_stream``, whatever the binding asked for -- so a binding
declaring ``streaming: false`` alongside such a capability would silently keep
streaming. The engine refuses to build that combination instead.

The capability that trips the guard below is built by this test: neither
``pydantic_ai_harness.Skills`` nor ``pydantic_ai.capabilities.NativeTool`` --
the only capabilities loom builds today -- overrides ``wrap_run_event_stream``,
so with loom's current grants the guard cannot fire. It stays anyway, because
pydantic-ai has a second, unrelated way to force streaming -- registering
``Hooks.on.event``/``Hooks.on.run_event_stream`` -- that ``has_wrap_run_event_stream``
does not see, and loom builds no ``Hooks`` capability today either.

"""State reaches the dependency bundle through the pydantic-ai engine (T303).

``PydanticAIEngine.run``/``run_stream`` receive ``state`` already resolved
by :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.AgentRuntime` and forward it to
:class:`~loom.ai.abc.DepsFactory` unchanged (FR-009). This is the last hop
before it reaches the composition root's ``_AgentDeps.state``
(``rest/fastapi/auto.py``), which T301 already covers untouched.

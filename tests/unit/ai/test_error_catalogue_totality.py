"""Every code-keyed catalogue must cover every code.

Three catalogues map an :class:`~loom.ai.errors.AgentRunErrorCode` to
something each transport needs.  All three document themselves as total, and
"total" was a comment: two raise ``KeyError`` or degrade silently on a gap,
and the third — the HTTP status table — degrades to a 500 by design for the
codes it lists as deliberate defaults, but a code missing from *both* its
mapped entries and its declared defaults is not a deliberate choice, it is a
code nobody decided about.  These tests make the claim checkable, so CI
reports the gap instead of production.

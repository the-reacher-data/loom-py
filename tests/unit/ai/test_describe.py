"""Projection of one compiled plan into its public description (US7).

``loom.ai.describe`` is the AI pillar's contribution to ``describe_app``: it
turns an :class:`~loom.ai.compiler._plan.AgentPlan` into the subset of itself
that is safe to publish.  The projection is an explicit allow-list per
capability kind — that is what makes the exclusions demonstrable rather than
incidental, so every kind is asserted here settings by settings.

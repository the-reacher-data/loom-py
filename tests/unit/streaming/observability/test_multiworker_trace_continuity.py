"""Trace continuity under the real multi-worker runtime, not the single-threaded harness.

``bytewax.testing.run_main`` is single-threaded, so a streaming test built on
it passes with plain contextvars and never exercises the path production takes.
These tests drive ``cli_main`` with more than one worker per process, which is
where a context that does not propagate would show up as spans landing on
random trace ids.

"""A message written to an outbound Kafka topic dies where it is written.

``TerminalReason.SINK_WRITE`` documented "a storage sink **or an outbound
topic**" while the Kafka write path emitted nothing, so a flow ending in
``IntoTopic`` — the most common streaming topology — produced a trace that
stopped at its last node span.

Every assertion here reads exported span structure or recorded lifecycle events
from a real SDK exporter and a real observer. Kafka is faked at the
confluent-producer level, so ``build_runtime_terminal_sinks`` builds the real
``_KafkaMessageSink`` and the wiring under test is the wiring exercised.

"""Commit accounting across nodes that change the record count.

Every node that turns one input record into N outputs shares one hazard: all N
outputs carry the same source offset, and each one completes that offset when it
reaches a terminal. The tracker expects exactly one completion per record, so a
node that fans out must raise that expectation before any output can be
completed, and a node that produces nothing must release the record itself.

Both failures are silent, which is why they are asserted here against a real
``KafkaCommitTracker`` and its committed offsets rather than against a spy:

- fan-out without a fork commits the offset after the *first* output, losing the
  remaining N-1 on a crash — the consumer group has already moved past them;
- zero outputs without a completion freezes the partition's watermark forever.

"""A shared MCP session that died after it opened serves the next call again.

The worker opens one session per server at start-up and every run and every
``Mcp()`` marker speaks through it. When the server behind it goes away after
that -- a transport error under an in-flight call, a redeploy, a child that
exits -- the holder the runtime keeps open also keeps the dead client from ever
being re-entered, so every later call failed until the process was restarted.
Driven over a real stdio child, which the test can kill.

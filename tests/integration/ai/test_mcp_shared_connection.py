"""One MCP connection per server, however many agents were granted it (FR-026).

``_remote_capabilities`` has always de-duplicated MCP clients per server, but
the run path used to build one ``MCPToolset`` per grant per agent, so a worker
held the start-up session *plus* one connection per agent — one dynamic client
registration and one credential resolution each, against servers that keep
clients in memory.

What these tests measure is therefore the **transport**, not the number of
toolset objects: ``_CountingTransport`` counts every time a client really
opened a session, which is the thing a remote server sees. The server is an
in-process ``fastmcp`` application reached over ``FastMCPTransport``, so the
real :class:`pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset` and its reference-counted entry are
under test and no socket is.

Sharing the toolset must not serialise the worker: the concurrency test is the
regression guard against ever routing runs through
:class:`~loom.ai.runtime.SharedMcpSession`, whose lock would queue every
agent's tool call behind every other agent's.

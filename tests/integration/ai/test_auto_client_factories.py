"""The composition root hands the runtime its client factories (FR-025, FR-040).

``create_app`` used to build :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.AgentRuntime` with neither
``mcp_client_factory`` nor ``a2a_client_factory``. An artifact granting either
kind therefore compiled and then aborted start-up with "no MCP client factory is
configured" — a failure no deployment could act on, because nothing in the
configuration file was wrong.

These tests drive the real ``create_app`` over a temporary project and enter its
lifespan, which is where the runtime opens its live clients. Both grants point
at addresses nothing serves, so start-up still fails; what must have changed is
*why*. The absence of the missing-factory wording is the assertion: it can only
be produced by a runtime that was handed no factory at all.

"""Helpers for asserting on exported spans in streaming observability tests.

Assertions in these tests read span structure — trace ids, parents, links,
counts — from a real SDK exporter. A test that builds a runtime with no
exporter gets non-recording spans and can assert nothing about them, which is
how four tracing defects shipped behind a green suite.

    """Lifecycle observer that records span durations and errors as Prometheus metrics.

    Instruments:

    - ``lifecycle_duration_seconds`` — Histogram, labels: ``scope``, ``name``.
      Observed on ``END`` events when ``duration_ms`` is present.
    - ``lifecycle_errors_total`` — Counter, labels: ``scope``, ``name``.
      Incremented on ``ERROR`` events.

    For long-running services (streaming, REST), metrics are served at ``/metrics``
    via the standard ``prometheus_client`` default registry. For batch jobs (ETL),
    pass ``pushgateway_url`` to push metrics to a Pushgateway at runner shutdown.

    Args:
        registry: Optional custom ``CollectorRegistry``. Pass an isolated registry
            in tests to prevent cross-test pollution.
        pushgateway_url: Pushgateway URL for batch-job metric delivery.
            Call :meth:`flush` explicitly at runner shutdown when set.

    Example::

        adapter = PrometheusLifecycleAdapter()
        runtime = ObservabilityRuntime([adapter])

        with runtime.span(Scope.USE_CASE, "CreateOrder"):
            ...

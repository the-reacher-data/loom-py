"""Parallel dispatcher protocol and built-in implementations.

The dispatcher is the extension point for how parallel step/process groups
are executed.  The executor delegates all parallelism decisions here,
keeping itself free of scheduling concerns.

Swap implementations to move from local threads to distributed workers::

    # Local (default)
    ETLExecutor(reader, writer, dispatcher=ThreadDispatcher())

    # Celery (sprint 5+)
    ETLExecutor(reader, writer, dispatcher=CeleryGroupDispatcher(app))

    # Databricks Jobs (enterprise)
    ETLExecutor(reader, writer, dispatcher=DatabricksJobDispatcher(client))

class ParallelDispatcher(Protocol):
    """Protocol for executing a group of independent tasks in parallel.

    All tasks in a group are independent — the executor guarantees no
    data dependency between them.  Implementations must:

    * Execute all tasks (not short-circuit on first failure).
    * Re-raise the first exception encountered after all tasks complete.

    Example::

        class CeleryGroupDispatcher:
            def run_all(self, tasks: Sequence[Callable[[], None]]) -> None:
                group(celery_wrap(t) for t in tasks).apply_async().get()

            Exception: First exception raised by any task, after all tasks
                       have been given the opportunity to complete.

    Suitable for I/O-bound workloads and Polars steps (Polars releases the GIL

    ``ProcessDispatcher`` or a Celery-based dispatcher.

    All tasks run to completion before any exception is re-raised — the
    observer receives error events for each failed task individually.

    Args:
        max_workers: Maximum thread pool size.  Defaults to the number of

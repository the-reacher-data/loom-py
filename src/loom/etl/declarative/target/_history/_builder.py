class IntoHistory:
    """Declare a Delta table as the ETL step SCD Type 2 history target.

    Each run compares incoming data against the current open vectors in the target
    table. Only changed entity states generate new rows — unchanged entities
    produce no writes.

    **Column roles:**

    * ``keys`` — entity identity. Never change; they are the MERGE join key.
    * ``track`` — change-triggering columns. A value change inserts a new row
      and closes the previous open vector. ``None`` means every non-key column
      is tracked.
    * ``overwrite`` — columns refreshed to their latest value without opening a
      new history row. In SNAPSHOT mode the open row is silently refreshed when
      the entity is UNCHANGED. In LOG mode consecutive same-``track`` events are
      collapsed into a single run whose ``valid_from`` anchors to the first event;
      these columns take the last observed value while the remaining payload
      columns freeze at the transition-time (first) value. Useful for mutable
      metadata that should not drive history.
    * *Remaining* — "passive" columns: carried forward into each new row but
      never updated nor tracked.

    **Multiple simultaneous open vectors** are natively supported. Include the
    distinguishing dimension in ``track``. For example, a player on loan to two
    clubs simultaneously uses ``track=(\"team_id\", \"role\")`` — the vectors
    ``(player_id=P1, team_id=RM, role=OWNER)`` and
    ``(player_id=P1, team_id=GET, role=LOAN)`` are independent and coexist
    without conflict.

    **Idempotency contract:**

    * Re-running the same effective date (same-day rerun) is idempotent in both
      SNAPSHOT and LOG mode: the run's effects are rolled back and reapplied,
      including reopening rows closed or soft-deleted by the previous run.
    * A SNAPSHOT backfill (effective date earlier than existing history) requires
      ``allow_temporal_rerun=True`` and is **destructive**: history from the
      effective date onward is discarded (within ``partition_scope`` when set)
      and rebuilt from the incoming snapshot. The write returns a
      :class:`~loom.etl.HistorifyRepairReport` listing the dates that must be
      re-processed — re-running the later days is the caller's responsibility.
    * A snapshot covering only part of the entity universe applies
      ``delete_policy`` to every absent entity. For partial backfills use
      ``delete_policy=\"ignore\"`` or restrict the run with ``partition_scope``.
    * LOG mode is idempotent by construction: replaying events converges, and a
      same-date correction for an entity replaces the stored event (incoming
      wins).
    * In LOG mode, two events for the same entity that share an effective
      instant (with different ``track`` values) collapse the earlier vector to
      zero width (``valid_from == valid_to``). Boundaries are inclusive, so a
      point-in-time query at exactly that instant matches both the zero-width
      row and the row opening at it; filter zero-width rows out
      (``valid_from < valid_to OR valid_to IS NULL``) when only the surviving
      state matters.

    Args:
        ref: Logical table reference — ``str`` or :class:`~loom.etl.TableRef`.
        keys: One or more column names that identify the entity.
            Must be non-empty and must not overlap with ``track``.
        effective_date: In ``\"log\"`` mode: name of the frame column carrying
            the event date/timestamp. In ``\"snapshot\"`` mode: a
            :class:`~loom.etl.ParamExpr` or column name resolved from run params.
        mode: ``\"snapshot\"`` (default) or ``\"log\"``.
        track: Columns whose changes trigger a new history row.
            ``None`` means all non-key columns are tracked.
        overwrite: Columns refreshed to their latest value without opening a new
            history row (in-place on the open row in SNAPSHOT; last-value of the
            collapsed same-``track`` run in LOG).
            Must not overlap with ``keys`` or ``track``.
        delete_policy: Action for absent keys in SNAPSHOT mode.
            Defaults to ``\"close\"``.
        partition_scope: Partition columns to constrain Delta reads/writes.
            Strongly recommended for large tables.
        valid_from: Name of the period-start column in the Delta table.
            Defaults to ``\"valid_from\"``.
        valid_to: Name of the period-end column in the Delta table.
            Defaults to ``\"valid_to\"``.
        date_type: Precision for boundary columns. Defaults to ``\"date\"``.
        schema: Schema evolution strategy.
            Defaults to :attr:`~SchemaMode.STRICT`.
        allow_temporal_rerun: Allow SNAPSHOT backfills with a past effective
            date. The run rewinds history: rows starting at or after the
            effective date are discarded, rows closed by discarded runs are
            reopened, and history is rebuilt from the incoming snapshot. When
            strictly-future rows were discarded, the write reports the dates
            requiring a downstream rerun. With ``False`` (default) a past
            effective date raises
            :class:`~loom.etl.HistorifyTemporalConflictError`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``keys`` is empty.
        ValueError: If ``track`` overlaps with ``keys``.
        ValueError: If ``overwrite`` overlaps with ``keys``, ``track``, or boundary columns.
        ValueError: If ``valid_from`` and ``valid_to`` share the same name.

    Partitions open existing rows into four disjoint sets:

    * Unchanged — exact match in incoming by full ``join_key`` → keep open.
    * Changed   — entity key in incoming, tracked values differ → always close.
    * Absent    — entity key not in incoming at all → apply delete policy.
    * New       — in incoming, not in open existing by ``join_key`` → insert open.

    The delete policy governs only the **absent** set.  Changed rows are always
    closed regardless of policy: the new snapshot provides explicit replacement
    state for the entity, so the old version is definitively superseded — it
    should not remain open alongside the new one regardless of IGNORE semantics.

    Closed historical rows are always preserved unchanged.

"""The N+1 rule: a batch operation produces N message spans and one batch span.

A batch has **N parents**. A trace is a tree with one parent per span, so it
cannot express that. OTEL span links are the standard mechanism for fan-in, so
every batch operation produces:

- one *participation* span per message, in that message's own trace, carrying
  ``loom.batch_id`` — this is where a message's story records that it took part
  in a batch, and for a sink write it is where the message dies;
- one *batch* span, in a trace of its own, with one link per participation
  span.

That is navigable both ways: message to batch through ``loom.batch_id``, batch
to messages through the links.

Links follow recording. A link is added only for a participation span that
will actually be exported: advertising an edge to a span the sampler dropped
points at nothing. The count is bounded by ``OtelConfig.max_span_links``, and
the batch span says so with ``loom.links_truncated`` when the bound bites.

Spans are opened *after* the work, with the real window as explicit start and
end timestamps, because the links can only point at contexts that genuinely
exist — which they do, because they were just created.

Sampling caveat: the batch span is a root in a trace of its own, so a
ratio-based sampler decides on *its* trace id like any other root. At a low
ratio most batch spans are therefore dropped along with most messages. What
holds at every ratio is the invariant that matters — a batch span that *is*
exported links to exactly the participation spans of its batch that were also
exported, and never to one that was not.

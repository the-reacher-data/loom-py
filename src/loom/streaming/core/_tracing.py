"""Span attributes derived from a streaming message, and terminal spans.

A message must be traceable from ingestion, through every node, to its death.
The trace id already travels on :class:`~loom.streaming.core._message.MessageMeta`;
what was missing is the *last* span — the one that says how the message ended.

``parent_trace_id`` and ``causation_id`` name a **different** message's trace.
They are emitted as attributes, never as the OTEL parent: another message's
trace is a link or an attribute, not a parent.

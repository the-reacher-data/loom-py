"""Storage sink protocols for the streaming DSL.

Defines the two-level contract between the streaming graph and any storage backend:
- SinkPartition: what runs per Bytewax worker (write_batch / close).
- IntoSink: what any Into* terminal node exposes to the compiler and adapter.

The compiler detects IntoSink nodes by structural protocol check — it never
inspects type names. Any frozen dataclass that satisfies IntoSink is a
first-class terminal node without registration or inheritance.

class IntoSink(Protocol[EventT]):
    """Structural protocol satisfied by all Into* terminal storage sink nodes.

    The compiler detects nodes implementing this protocol through a structural
    isinstance check and resolves their config from streaming.sinks.<name>.
    The adapter calls build_partition() once per Bytewax worker to obtain the
    SinkPartition that handles epoch writes and shutdown.

    Implementing a custom Into* node requires no framework imports, no
    registration, and no base class — any frozen dataclass with the four
    declared members satisfies this protocol and is treated identically to
    built-in nodes such as IntoTable.

        @dataclass(frozen=True)
        class IntoMongo(Generic[EventT]):

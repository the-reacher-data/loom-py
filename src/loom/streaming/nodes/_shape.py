class CollectBatch(LoomFrozenStruct, frozen=True):
    """Explicit shape adapter from ``record`` to ``batch``.

    Pattern:
        Shape adapter.

    Groups individual records into batches before handing them to downstream
    batch-aware nodes. Batch is an **optimization grouping**, not a
    first-class semantic unit — downstream nodes receive and return individual
    records after the batch step executes.

    Args:
        max_records: Maximum records collected into one batch.
        timeout_ms: Maximum wait time before materializing a partial batch.
        window: Windowing strategy to use for grouping. Defaults to
            ``WindowStrategy.COLLECT`` (processing-time count-and-timeout).
        event_time: When ``True``, use ``MessageMeta.produced_at_ms`` as the
            event clock instead of wall time. Requires a windowing strategy
            other than ``COLLECT``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``max_records`` or ``timeout_ms`` are below one, or
            if ``event_time=True`` is combined with ``WindowStrategy.COLLECT``.

    Example:
        Collect up to 100 records or wait 500 ms::

            CollectBatch(max_records=100, timeout_ms=500)

    Pattern:
        Inclusive fan-out.

    Unlike :class:`~loom.streaming.Fork`, which routes each message to exactly
    one branch, ``Broadcast`` copies the message to every declared branch.
    All branches are independent: they may apply different transformations and
    write to different output topics.

    ``Broadcast`` is terminal — no process nodes may follow it.

    Args:
        *routes: One or more :class:`BroadcastRoute` declarations.

        ValueError: If no routes are provided.

    Example::

        Broadcast(

"""Bounded retry for transient Kafka group-coordinator errors.

Every consumer-group offset operation — ``OffsetFetch`` and ``OffsetCommit`` —
is answered by the broker that coordinates the group. That coordinator is not
always available: it is elected lazily, its ``__consumer_offsets`` partition has
to be loaded into memory first, and it moves on broker restart or partition
reassignment. While that is happening the broker answers with a *retriable*
protocol error, and the correct client behaviour is to back off and ask again —
not to fail the caller.

Without this, a flow reading from a cluster whose coordinator is still settling
dies at startup with an opaque ``NOT_COORDINATOR``, which is the single most
likely way a healthy deployment fails on its first run.

Note on classification: ``KafkaError.retriable()`` is deliberately **not** used.
It reports whether librdkafka will retry the request internally, which is a
different question from whether the Kafka protocol considers the error
transient — it is ``False`` for ``NOT_COORDINATOR``. Only the explicit code set
below decides, so adding a code is a visible, reviewed change.

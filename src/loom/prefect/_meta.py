"""Cross-package metadata bridging the flow factory and the deployer.

The ``etl_flow()`` factory attaches a frozen ``ETLFlowMeta`` to each
decorated flow at ``__loom_etl_meta__``. The deployer reads it back to
build the matching Prefect Deployment. The type lives here, next to
``loom.prefect._flow_yaml``, so that ``loom.prefect.flow`` imports nothing
from ``loom.prefect.deploy``; the only cross-package edge is deploy → flow.

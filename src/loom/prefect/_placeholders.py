"""Placeholder DSL for dynamic ETL parameters.

Supported tokens (case-sensitive):

- ``${today}``, ``${today+Nd}``, ``${today-Nd}`` → :class:`datetime.date`
- ``${yesterday}`` → :class:`datetime.date` (alias of ``${today-1d}``)
- ``${now}``, ``${now±Nd}``, ``${now±Nh}``, ``${now±Nm}`` →
  timezone-aware UTC :class:`datetime.datetime`

Any value that looks like ``${...}`` but does not match one of the three
valid patterns raises :class:`ValueError`. Non-string values and strings
that do not look like placeholders pass through unchanged.

Tokens count from an *anchor* instant, read in UTC. Inside a Prefect flow
run the anchor is the run's scheduled start, so the processed window belongs
to the run and not to the moment it happens to execute:

- a scheduled run resolves against its slot, even when it starts late;
- a retry (by the engine or "Retry" in the UI) resolves against the same slot;
- a manual run resolves against the time it was created.

A run that starts late therefore gets ``${now}`` up to its scheduled time,
not up to the wall clock. Without an anchor the tokens use the wall clock.

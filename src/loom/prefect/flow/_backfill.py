    """Build a Prefect flow that backfills a pipeline one chunk at a time.

    Unlike :func:`~loom.prefect.etl_flow`, which runs a pipeline once over the
    whole parameter window, ``backfill_flow`` slices the window
    ``[window_start_field, window_end_field)`` into ``chunk``-aligned partitions
    (``[C, C+1chunk)``) and runs ``per_chunk_processes`` once per chunk, oldest
    first. After all chunks it runs ``finalize_processes`` once — the finalize
    run's ``window_end_field`` is pinned to the start of the *current* chunk
    (not ``now``) so downstream batch-sequenced refreshes get a stable boundary.

    The flow is registered without Prefect retries on purpose: a failed
    backfill should be resumed from the failed chunk via ``start_from`` rather
    than replayed from the beginning. Naive datetimes (window fields and
    ``start_from``) are assumed to be UTC.

    Args:
        name: Logical flow name shown in the Prefect UI.
        pipeline: ``ETLPipeline`` subclass to execute.
        params_type: ``msgspec.Struct`` whose fields become typed flow kwargs.
            Must carry the two window fields named below.
        config_path: Path to the per-flow YAML (schedule, params, tags, …).
        source_file: ``__file__`` of the calling module (needed by Prefect
            ``from_source`` to locate the flow on disk).
        per_chunk_processes: Process/step names run once for each chunk window.
            Validated against the compiled pipeline at build time.
        finalize_processes: Process/step names run once after all chunks.
            Validated against the compiled pipeline at build time.
        window_start_field: Name of the datetime field holding the window start.
        window_end_field: Name of the datetime field holding the (exclusive)
            window end; also the field pinned on the finalize run.
        chunk: Partition granularity used to slice the window.
        storage_config_path: Path to the loom storage YAML read at runtime.
            Overridable via ``LOOM_STORAGE_CONFIG_PATH``.
        manifest_store: Optional manifest backend, for observability only.
            Each chunk gets its own correlation id so manifests never leak
            across chunks. Completed steps are NOT skipped on re-runs — the
            only resume mechanism is ``start_from``, at chunk granularity.

    Returns:
        A ``@prefect.flow``-decorated callable with ``__loom_etl_meta__``
        attached for the deployer. It accepts ``start_from`` to resume the
        backfill from a given chunk (earlier chunks are skipped), plus ``env``
        for deploy parity with :func:`~loom.prefect.etl_flow` (logged, not
        used for routing).

    Raises:
        TypeError: When a process list is not ``list[str]``.
        ValueError: When a process/step name does not exist in *pipeline*.

"""Prefect entrypoint for ETLs declared in YAML.

Prefect loads ``loom.prefect.deploy.entrypoint.<attribute>``, where
``<attribute>`` is the ETL name with hyphens replaced by underscores, and gets
the flow rebuilt from the declaration file named by ``LOOM_ETL_CONFIG``.
Names starting with ``_`` raise ``AttributeError`` as in any module; a public
name raises ``ConfigError`` when the variable is unset or the file declares no
ETL for it.

    A flow retry is scheduled by the server rather than awaited in place: the
    run returns to ``AwaitingRetry`` and a worker claims it again later, so the
    container exits while it waits and hour-scale delays cost nothing.

        flow_retries: Number of full-flow retries Prefect will attempt before
            declaring the run failed (each retry is a new container).

            the run. Prefect's ``FlowRunPolicy`` validates this as a single
            integer, so a list of staggered delays is rejected here rather than
            failing mid-run — see :func:`_coerce_retry_delay`.

"""Request-body size cap for the whole application.

Neither uvicorn nor Starlette caps the size of a request body: an endpoint that
calls ``await request.body()`` will happily buffer whatever the client keeps
sending, and a chunked upload with no end takes the worker down with it.

The cap lives in an ASGI middleware rather than in a handler so it also covers
routes the application mounted by hand.  Endpoints with a stricter budget — the
SQL endpoint, for instance — apply theirs on top.

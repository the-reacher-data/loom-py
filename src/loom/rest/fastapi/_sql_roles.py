"""Identity-bound role resolution for the SQL endpoint (spec §4).

The effective roles of a query are derived from the VERIFIED identity the
authentication middleware published, never from the request body.  The body may
only narrow the resulting set.  Resolution is fail-closed: an anonymous caller
or one holding no allowlisted role is denied, and ``default_role`` is never a
fallback once a connection binds roles to identity.

This module knows nothing about tokens or claims: whichever mechanism
authenticated the caller, it sees the same
:class:`~loom.core.identity.identity.Identity`.

Internal module: the resolved values are consumed by
:mod:`loom.rest.fastapi.sql` and are not part of the public API.

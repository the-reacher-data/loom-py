"""Startup validation of the authentication exclusion list.

Authentication excludes paths by exact string, but Starlette routes by
*template*: a route declared as ``/{tenant}`` matches ``/metrics`` just as
happily as ``/acme``.  An operator excluding ``/metrics`` would therefore be
serving a business route with no credentials at all, and nothing at request
time would say so.

This module closes that gap where it can still be fixed: at startup, by asking
the router itself which routes each exclusion reaches.

Internal module: consumed by :func:`loom.rest.fastapi.auto.create_app`.

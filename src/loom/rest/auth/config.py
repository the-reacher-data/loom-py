    Separate from :class:`JwtAuthConfig` on purpose, and not a few extra fields
    on it: a service that only verifies must have no configuration path through
    which signing material can land in its process.  The fields diverge anyway —
    one algorithm instead of an allowlist, ``audience`` and ``issuer`` mandatory
    rather than optional, a lifetime the verifier has no use for.

    The private key is read from ``private_key_path`` and never held as a field.
    ``__repr__`` redaction would not be enough: this is a ``msgspec.Struct``, so
    ``msgspec.json.encode`` and ``to_builtins`` emit every field verbatim without
    going through it, and a config dump would publish the signing key.

    Attributes:
        private_key_path: Filesystem path of the PEM signing key, for
            asymmetric algorithms. Mutually exclusive with the other sources.
        private_key_ref: Managed-store reference of the PEM signing key, as
            ``"<resolver>:<key>"`` with resolver one of ``secrets`` or ``ssm``
            (e.g. ``"secrets:/myapp/prod/jwt-signing-key"``). Resolved once,
            when the issuer loads the key, so the material never touches disk
            or config — and rotating the stored value requires a restart. The
            Secrets Manager resolver navigates dots as JSON paths, so the key
            name must not contain ``.``. Mutually exclusive with the other
            sources.
        key_ref_region: AWS region the ref resolver is built with. Defaults to
            boto3's own resolution chain. Requires ``private_key_ref``.
        secret_path: Filesystem path of the shared secret for HS* algorithms.
            Requires ``allow_symmetric_signing``. Mutually exclusive with the
            other sources.
        algorithm: The single algorithm tokens are signed with. Issuing chooses
            one; only verification negotiates an allowlist.
        audience: ``aud`` stamped on every token. Mandatory: a token without an
            audience is valid at any service that shares the key.
        issuer: ``iss`` stamped on every token. Mandatory.
        roles_claim: Claim carrying the caller roles. Mandatory, and never a
            registered claim: an issuer that does not own that name lets an
            attribute impersonate it. An identity without roles is refused.
        ttl_seconds: Lifetime of a minted token, in ``1..MAX_ISSUER_TTL_SECONDS``,
            and the ceiling for any per-call override.
        kid: Key identifier stamped on the token header, so a verifier can
            select the right key during a rotation overlap.
        allow_symmetric_signing: Opt-in required for HS*. With a shared secret
            every verifier can also mint, so the choice must be deliberate.

    Raises:
        ConfigError: If key sources, algorithm, audience, issuer, roles claim
            or lifetime are invalid.

    Note:
        Built programmatically, not bound from a config section: issuing happens in
        an application use case that injects the issuer, not in the REST layer that
        owns ``app.rest.auth``. Resolve the values however the service resolves its
        own settings.

"""The ``on_output`` hook: one use case per completed run, engine-neutral.

Sits outside the limit supervisor and outside every engine: when the
supervised stream produces its terminal event, the wrapper here runs the
plan's hook use case as the caller — through the deps bundle's bound invoker,
so the executor binds ``Caller()`` to the run's identity — and re-creates the
terminal event with the run's ``interaction_id`` and the hook's result.  An
engine never sees the hook, so its own retry loop cannot replay it.

Nothing here imports an engine or an optional extra.

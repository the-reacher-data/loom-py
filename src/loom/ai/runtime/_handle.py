"""The concrete :class:`~loom.ai.abc.McpHandle`/:class:`~loom.ai.abc.AgentHandle`
an ``Mcp()`` or ``Agent()`` marker resolves to.

Two markers, two resolvers, never one constructed by application code:

* ``Agent()`` resolves through :func:`agent_marker_resolver`, handed to the
  executor via
  :meth:`~loom.core.engine.executor.RuntimeExecutor.bind_agent_resolver`.
  Running the resolved handle reuses :meth:`AgentRuntime.run` unchanged, so
  the same concurrency admission and the same policies a transport-driven
  run goes through apply here too; nothing in this module opens a parallel
  path around them.
* ``Mcp()`` resolves through :func:`mcp_marker_resolver` (T302), handed to
  the executor via
  :meth:`~loom.core.engine.executor.RuntimeExecutor.bind_mcp_resolver` — a
  second, differently-typed resolver, not an overload of the first (S7).
  It builds a caller-bound :class:`~loom.ai.runtime._grants.McpGrantView`
  over the server's shared substrate grant
  (:meth:`AgentRuntime.use_case_mcp_grant`), filtered by the *resolving
  binding's own* ``include`` — never by the shared grant's, which carries
  none (see :mod:`~loom.ai.runtime._grants`'s module docstring and
  ``plan.md``'s "Where the caller's include comes from"). A server tolerated
  unreachable under ``ai.remote_clients: optional`` resolves to
  :class:`_UnavailableMcpHandle` instead (T303).

Three run modes (T304, ``Agent()`` path only): ``run(prompt)`` decodes into
the artefact's own declared output; ``run(prompt, expect=X)`` decodes this
call only into ``X``, skipping the artefact's own output check, which is
compiled against the declared schema and cannot be asked to validate another
one; ``run_text`` decodes nothing at all. Both overrides are refused before
the model is called when the artefact's output hook declares the ``output``
field — see :meth:`AgentRuntime.output_hook_shape_bound` — because that
hook's command is compiled against the declared shape and cannot be handed
another one. A hook declaring only conversation-bookkeeping fields is
unaffected and keeps running with every mode.

``mcp()`` and ``sql()`` (T301/T303) on the ``Agent()`` path return the
artefact's own granted views, built by :mod:`~loom.ai.runtime._grants`: the
same filtered session and the same bounded connection the model's own
capabilities run over, never a second one.

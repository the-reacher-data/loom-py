"""The ``conversation`` loader: one use case before a run that continues a thread.

Runs in the runtime's single path, before any engine stream opens, as the
caller — through the deps bundle's bound invoker, exactly as the output hook
— and hands the engine a neutral :class:`~loom.ai.abc.Conversation`.  The
history is opaque bytes the loader returned: nothing here decodes, inspects
or retains it, and nothing here imports an engine or an optional extra.

"""The grant views an :class:`~loom.ai.abc.AgentHandle` exposes (T301–T303).

``McpGrantView`` and ``SqlGrantView`` reach exactly what the artefact already
grants and what the runtime already opened — never a second connection and
never a second filter:

* :class:`McpGrantView` filters the tools this server's shared session
  advertises with the same include/exclude rule
  :func:`~loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai._capabilities._tool_predicate` applies
  to the model's own toolset, over the same
  :class:`~loom.ai.runtime._mcp.SharedMcpSession`
  :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.AgentRuntime` opened at start-up. There is no
  second filter that could diverge from the model's, because there is no
  second filter.
* :class:`SqlGrantView` runs under the grant's own row and byte bounds, with
  roles resolved from the verified caller through
  :func:`~loom.ai._roles.bound_query_roles` — the one place that binding
  lives, called by the model's own ``sql`` capability too, with no
  caller-supplied role.

Both bound one call by the plan's own ``tool_timeout_ms``, inside a span —
the neutral counterpart of
:func:`~loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai._guards.capability_call`, since this
package stays free of any one engine. What is deliberately **not** carried
over from the model-facing path is turning a failure into a refusal *value*
(:func:`~loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai._guards.guarded`): that exists so a model
can read a refusal and try again, and the consumer of a grant view is
application code, which reads an exception instead.

"""Mounting policy of the A2A surface: what is published, and how safely.

Selection, the start-up refusals and the authentication-exclusion bookkeeping.
None of this is A2A-specific — it is the policy any surface publishing an agent
to the public internet has to satisfy — which is why it is stated once here
rather than inline in the transport.

**Only the card is anonymous.** Binding reads the exclusions mounted on the
application's authentication middleware and refuses to start when any of them
covers a path under the A2A or the agents prefix other than a card path
(FR-041b); it then registers the card paths as the sole exclusion. Publishing
an agent no caller could ever authenticate against is refused too.

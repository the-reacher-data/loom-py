"""Pure A2A projection of a compiled agent.

Holds the card projection and the event projection, both derived from the
compiled :class:`~loom.ai.compiler.AgentPlan` alone (R-005). Neither imports an
A2A SDK nor a web framework, so importing this package on a base installation
succeeds and the redaction guarantee (FR-038, SC-009) is unit-testable. The
transport server lives behind the ``ai-a2a`` extra and is not re-exported here.

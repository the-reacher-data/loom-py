"""Pure projection of a compiled agent into its public A2A agent card.

Implements the projection table of ``specs/001-ai-agent-layer/contracts/a2a.md``
and the purity decision of R-005: the card is derived from the compiled
:class:`~loom.ai.compiler.AgentPlan` alone, with no A2A SDK and no web framework
on the import path, so the redaction guarantee (FR-038, SC-009) is enforced by a
plain unit test in the base wheel instead of an integration test.

The card says *what* the agent does and never *how it is built*: instructions,
model binding, execution policies, free-form metadata and every compiled
capability handle stay inside the process.

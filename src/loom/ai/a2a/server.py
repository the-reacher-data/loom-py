"""Inbound A2A transport: one JSON-RPC endpoint and one card per published agent.

Implements ``specs/001-ai-agent-layer/contracts/a2a.md`` on top of
:class:`~loom.ai.runtime.AgentRuntime`, reusing the pure projections of
:mod:`loom.ai.a2a.card` and :mod:`loom.ai.a2a.events`. Nothing here re-derives
the card or the event mapping: this module is transport only, and the rules
every agent transport shares — the body cap, the caller check, the span that
survives a disconnect and the heartbeat race — come from
:mod:`loom.ai._transport` rather than from the HTTP surface's private names.

**Deviation from ``fasta2a.pydantic_ai.agent_to_a2a``.** The dependency is real
— ``fasta2a.schema`` is the wire contract and the error taxonomy used below —
but its ready-made application is not mounted, for four reasons:

1. ``fasta2a.task_manager.TaskManager.stream_message`` raises
   ``NotImplementedError``, so ``message/stream`` — the method this contract
   requires (FR-039a) — is not served at all.
2. Unimplemented methods surface as HTTP 500, not as the JSON-RPC error the
   contract requires; the card it builds even advertises ``streaming: false``.
3. ``agent_to_a2a`` requires a concrete ``pydantic_ai.Agent`` and drives the run
   through its own worker, storage and broker. That bypasses the caller's
   ``Identity``, ``max_concurrent_runs``, ``run_timeout_ms``, the run span and
   the outward redaction — every guarantee the runtime exists to enforce.
4. Its card is fixed (protocol 0.3.0, hardcoded modes, all capabilities false)
   and derived from engine state, which is exactly what R-005 rejects.

This module is composition only. The three layers it assembles each state
their own rules: :mod:`loom.ai.a2a._rpc` owns the JSON-RPC envelope and the
error taxonomy, :mod:`loom.ai.a2a._handlers` owns the methods, and
:mod:`loom.ai.a2a._binding` owns what may be published and how safely — the
start-up refusals and the authentication exclusions included.

    authenticated JSON-RPC route serving ``message/send`` and ``message/stream``;
    every other A2A method answers a named JSON-RPC error, as its card says.

    Args:
        app: FastAPI application to mount the routes on.
        runtime: Entered runtime serving the agents.
        config: Parsed ``ai:`` section.
        plans: Compiled plans the runtime was built from; the card is projected
            from them, which is why they are passed explicitly instead of read
            back out of the runtime.
        authenticator: Mechanism authenticating callers; its name selects the
            security scheme the card advertises.
        exclude_paths: Extra authentication exclusions to validate against the
            invocation surface (FR-041b). The exclusions mounted on the
            application's :class:`AuthenticationMiddleware` are read directly
            and always validated; this argument only adds to them.
        observability_runtime: Runtime emitting one span per run.
        prefix: Path prefix the A2A surface is mounted under.
        agents_prefix: Path prefix the HTTP agent surface is mounted under,
            guarded by the same exclusion check.

    Raises:
        AgentCompilationError: With ``AUTH_EXCLUSION_OVERLAPS_AGENTS`` when an
            exclusion covers an invocation path.
        ConfigError: When an agent is published without a usable authenticator
            and without an explicit anonymous opt-out, or when the card paths
            cannot be excluded from authentication.

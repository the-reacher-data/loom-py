"""Model binding value type shared by the compiler and the engine.

:class:`InferenceTarget` lives in its own module rather than in
``loom.ai.config`` because it is a value type of the pillar: the compiler
embeds it in the plan and the engine consumes it, so it is not a
config-parsing detail.

Secret containment (data-model invariant 4, FR-018): ``credentials_ref`` and
``options`` never leave the process in clear text.  The mechanism is
fail-closed — on construction both values are rewrapped into types msgspec
refuses to encode, so ``msgspec.json.encode`` (and ``msgspec.to_builtins``,
``msgspec.msgpack.encode``) raise ``TypeError`` instead of leaking them, and
``repr``/``str`` redact them.  Rejecting the encode was chosen over silent
redaction because a plan that reaches a wire encoder with a secret reference
aboard is a bug worth surfacing, not smoothing over.  Decoding through the
config loader is unaffected: ``msgspec.convert`` builds the struct from plain
values and ``__post_init__`` wraps them afterwards.

every exhaustive dispatch over it (``_spec.build_output_type``) fail type
checking until it handles the new mode, instead of degrading to a default at

    ``repr``/``str`` show ``provider``, ``model``, ``region``, ``endpoint``

    carries this struct, so an unredacted repr in a start-up traceback is the

    secret-bearing field is set (see the module docstring for the rationale).

        provider: Provider identifier (``bedrock``, ``openai``, ...).

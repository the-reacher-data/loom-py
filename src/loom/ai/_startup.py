"""Start-up verification of use-case marker bindings, shared by every worker.

Both composition roots that admit a marker — the FastAPI auto-bootstrap
(:mod:`loom.rest.fastapi.auto`) and the Celery worker bootstrap
(:mod:`loom.celery.bootstrap`) — call :func:`verify_agent_markers` once every
compiled use case declaring at least one ``Agent()`` binding is already known
via :func:`~loom.core.use_case.agent_markers.declaring_agent_bindings`, so
neither ever imports this module for a deployment that declares no marker at
all (FR-050). :func:`verify_mcp_markers` follows the same shape for the
``Mcp()`` marker, driven by
:func:`~loom.core.use_case.mcp_markers.declaring_mcp_bindings` instead.

The Celery worker never builds an AI runtime (T402: task workers do not serve
the AI pillar), so it always calls :func:`verify_agent_markers` with an empty
``plans_by_name`` and :func:`verify_mcp_markers` with an empty server
mapping — each reports every declared name as unknown, the same message a
typo gets under a real runtime, naming the parameter and the use case that
could not run.

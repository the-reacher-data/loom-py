"""Engine and provider resolution for the AI pillar.

Resolves the configured engine through :mod:`loom.core.plugins.entrypoints`
(group ``loom.ai.engines``, duplicates rejected — FR-021) and offers the two
helpers engines use to fail fast on missing provider SDKs and settings.

This module never imports a concrete engine: the entry point is loaded by
name and the handshake is a ``getattr`` on the loaded object, never an
``isinstance`` check, so the contract stays structural.

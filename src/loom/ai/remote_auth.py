"""Pluggable authentication for the remote endpoints an agent calls out to.

One registry serves both outbound transports — the MCP servers of
``ai.mcp_servers`` and the remote agents of ``ai.a2a_agents``.  Loom ships
**no login flow of its own**.  A deployment names a strategy in that endpoint's
``auth.kind``; loom resolves the name in the entry-point group
:data:`REMOTE_AUTH_ENTRY_POINT_GROUP`, calls the registered object with the rest
of the block as keyword arguments, and hands the result to the client.  The
artifact keeps saying only ``server: <name>`` or ``agent: <name>``, so it moves
between environments unchanged whether that endpoint needs no credential, a
fixed header, or a token exchange.

**One group, named for what it authenticates, not for who called first.**  The
contract for a strategy is whatever the HTTP client accepts — not an
abstraction of ours — and nothing about ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` is
MCP-specific, so a deployment that authenticates to one internal service
registers its strategy once and grants it to either transport.  The group was introduced in 1.7.0 as
``loom.ai.mcp_auth``, when MCP was its only consumer; keeping that name for
A2A strategies too would make it a lie for half its contents and would leave a
third party unable to tell which transports its registration is offered to, so
the group was renamed the release after it appeared, with no deprecation cycle
because it had no consumers yet.

Any existing ``httpx.Auth`` class in the ecosystem is registered as it stands,
with no adapter::

    [project.entry-points."loom.ai.remote_auth"]
    agent-session = "my_package.auth:AgentSessionAuth"

Loom registers three strategies, all thin delegations to what the libraries
already provide:

``oauth``
    Returns the sentinel the MCP client understands, so the client's own
    standard OAuth flow runs.  Loom implements none of it.  It is the one
    strategy that returns no auth object at all, and therefore the one an A2A
    agent cannot use: :func:`shared_a2a_auth` refuses it by name rather than
    connecting without it.
``bearer``
    ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` from a token the deployment resolves.
``static``
    Fixed headers, resolved by the deployment's secret resolver.

``headers_ref`` and ``auth`` are mutually exclusive on one endpoint, and
``auth: {kind: static, ...}`` is the long spelling of the shorthand: both read
the same ``Name=value`` payload through :func:`headers_from_ref`.  Reach for
``bearer`` whenever the credential is a token, since the composed header cannot
be written in configuration at all.

**Two HTTP libraries, one callable.**  The MCP toolset comes from
``pydantic-ai``, whose HTTP client is ``httpx2``, and it reaches that client
through the MCP transport, which passes any auth object it does not recognise
straight through; loom builds the A2A client itself, with ``httpx``.  Each of
the two libraries accepts an auth object only when it is an instance of *its
own* ``Auth`` class, a two-tuple, or a **callable**, so a class written against
one flavour is refused by the other and loom adapts neither.  The two
strategies loom ships therefore return a plain callable — the one shape both
clients accept, and the supported answer for a deployment's own fixed-header
strategy.  A strategy that needs a real flow registers a class, written against
the flavour of the transport that will use it.

A callable is a single-shot flow: it sets headers on the request it is handed,
returns it, and never sees the response.  A class that does need the response
body must know that ``requires_response_body`` is honoured by ``Auth``'s own
base flow, not by the client, so a strategy that overrides ``async_auth_flow``
replaces the very code that reads the flag and has to ``await response.aread()``
itself.

Nothing here imports an HTTP library at all, at module load or later: ``httpx``
reaches a deployment with the A2A client and ``httpx2`` with the MCP one, both
optional, while the strategy-name check runs during configuration decode in
every deployment.

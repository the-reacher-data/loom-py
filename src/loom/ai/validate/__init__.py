"""Standalone agent artifact validation (FR-015).

``python -m loom.ai.validate <globs>`` decodes every matching artifact and
runs the configuration-independent compiler phases — structure (via the
version envelope), output and policy limits — so a generator gets coded
feedback with no deployment configuration, no credentials and no network.

Exit status is ``0`` with an empty stderr when every artifact is valid;
otherwise every issue is printed to stderr as one line carrying its
:class:`~loom.ai.errors.AgentErrorCode`.

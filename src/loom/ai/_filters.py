"""Flat include/exclude selection shared by every filtered capability.

``mcp``, ``skills`` and ``a2a`` all narrow a list of names the same way: an
``include`` allow-list of glob patterns, then an ``exclude`` deny-list applied
on top.  The rule lives here once so the compiler (which filters skill names
offline) and the runtime (which filters real tool names at start-up) cannot
drift apart.

Matching is case-sensitive on every platform: names come from a remote server
or a directory listing, and a filter that silently widened on a
case-insensitive filesystem would be a permission difference between
environments.

"""Tier-1 authored artifact structs for agent spec version 1.

These structs are the *authored* surface: what a human or a generator writes in
an ``.agent.yaml`` file. They are engine-agnostic and vendor-agnostic — no
engine, provider, model identifier or credential is representable here.

Every struct is frozen, keyword-only and rejects unknown fields, so an
unrecognised key is a decoding failure rather than a silently dropped value
(FR-005).

The module-level constants are the single source of truth for the published
JSON Schema: :mod:`loom.ai.declarative._schema` derives every pattern, default,
minimum and maximum from them so the schema cannot drift from the structs.

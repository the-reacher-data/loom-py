"""Authored agent artifacts: Tier-1 structs, envelope decoding and loading.

This package is the only supported entry point for artifacts a human or a
generator writes. It is import-light on purpose: no optional extra is imported
at module level, so ``import loom.ai.declarative`` works on a base install even
though YAML artifacts need PyYAML.

Example:
    >>> specs = load_specs(["agents/*.agent.yaml"])
    >>> [decoded.spec.name for decoded in specs]
    ['triage']

    """Load every artifact matching a set of globs.

    Patterns are resolved relative to ``root``; matches are de-duplicated across
    patterns and returned sorted by path, so the result is deterministic.
    ``.yaml``/``.yml`` files decode as YAML, ``.json`` files as JSON, and any
    other extension is a failure.

    Failures from every file are accumulated and reported once, so a broken
    artifact does not hide the ones after it. Non-fatal findings ride on each
    returned :class:`DecodedSpec`. Duplicate agent names are *not* checked here:
    that is a later compilation phase over the whole application.

    Args:
        patterns: Glob patterns, relative to ``root``.
        root:     Directory the patterns are resolved against.

    Returns:
        One decoded artifact per matched file, ordered by path.

    Raises:
        AgentCompilationError: Aggregating every fatal issue found across all
            matched files.

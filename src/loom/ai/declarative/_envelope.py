"""Two-phase decoding of authored agent artifacts.

Phase 1 reads *only* the envelope — ``spec_version`` — with a permissive struct.
Phase 2 decodes the whole payload with the struct registered for that version,
strictly, so an unknown field is a failure rather than a dropped value.

Splitting the two phases is what makes forward compatibility diagnosable: an
artifact written for a future version is reported as
:data:`~loom.ai.errors.AgentErrorCode.SPEC_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` instead of
producing a pile of unrelated field errors.

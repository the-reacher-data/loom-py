"""Shielding one in-flight call from its own caller's cancellation.

An MCP session — wrapped in :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.SharedMcpSession` or
already declaring :class:`~loom.ai.abc.ConcurrentMcpSession` — makes the same
promise to every caller sharing it: a call already running finishes even if
the caller waiting on it is cancelled, so the session stays consistent for
whoever else is using it. :func:`shield_and_drain` is that promise, kept in
one place so neither the runtime's own lock nor a session that declares
itself already concurrency-safe has to restate it.

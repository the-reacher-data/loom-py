"""Shared SQL role-binding rule for every ``sql`` capability caller (T204/T303).

The model-facing ``sql`` tool
(:mod:`loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai._capabilities`) and the marker-facing
``sql`` grant view (:mod:`loom.ai.runtime._grants`) resolve the caller's
roles through the exact same rule: roles are bound to the verified identity
— never to a caller-supplied argument — and an empty result is refused
rather than silently falling back to the connection's shared ``default_role``
(FR-043a). The rule lives here once, the way :mod:`loom.ai._filters` holds
the include/exclude rule both paths also share, so the two callers cannot
drift apart.

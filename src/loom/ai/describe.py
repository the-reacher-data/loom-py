"""Public projection of compiled agents (US7).

The AI pillar's contribution to
:func:`~loom.core.introspection.describe_app`: it turns each compiled
:class:`~loom.ai.compiler._plan.AgentPlan` into the subset of itself that is
safe to publish.

The projection is an explicit allow-list per capability kind, not a dump of
the compiled struct.  A grant carries the resolved handle next to the public
name — the SQL connection config next to its name, the MCP URL next to its
server — so publishing "everything but a deny-list" would leak the moment a
new field appears.  A kind with no registered projection is therefore an
error, never a guess.

Excluded at agent level (FR-054): ``instructions``, the resolved
``inference`` target, the built ``output.decoder`` and the author's free-form
``metadata``.

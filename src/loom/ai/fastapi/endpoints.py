"""HTTP surface of the agent runtime: ``/run``, ``/stream`` and ``/health``.

Mirrors :func:`loom.rest.fastapi.sql.bind_sql_endpoints`. Mounting is a double
opt-in — an agent needs ``enabled`` **and** a named ``auth`` in ``ai.endpoints``
— every mount is announced with a WARNING carrying its security state, and an
agent that opts in without a usable authenticator aborts start-up instead of
serving anonymously by accident.

Two request-path rules come straight from the contract
(``specs/001-ai-agent-layer/contracts/http-sse.md``):

* Authentication is evaluated **before** existence, so an anonymous probe for
  an unknown agent gets ``401`` and the surface cannot be used to enumerate the
  agents an application runs (FR-029b).
* The body is capped **while it is read**. The declared ``Content-Length`` is a
  fast path for honest clients, never the cap (FR-033a).

Both are enforced by :mod:`loom.ai._transport`, which the A2A surface shares:
they are properties of an agent transport, not of this wire protocol.

    ``conversation_id`` is opaque to the runtime: it selects the conversation the

    verbatim into the output hook's command. Its bounds are enforced here, at decode, so an
    out-of-range value is a ``422`` and never reaches the runtime.

    ``state`` is ``msgspec.Raw`` rather than a decoded value: this struct is
    decoded by the one module-level :data:`_REQUEST_DECODER` shared by every
    agent, which cannot know any one artefact's declared state shape.
    ``Raw`` stops decoding at this field, so :func:`_decode_state` can parse
    those bytes exactly once, against the artefact's own shape (FR-008).

    Typed plain ``msgspec.Raw``, not ``Raw | None``: measured against
    ``msgspec`` 0.20.0, a ``Raw``-bearing union accepts a JSON ``null`` for
    the field but rejects any other value with ``ValidationError``, which
    would refuse every caller who actually sends ``state``. The default is
    an empty ``Raw`` — indistinguishable, once decoded, from an explicit

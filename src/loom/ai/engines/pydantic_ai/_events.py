"""Engine stream events → loom's closed :data:`~loom.ai.abc.AgentEvent` union.

The union has five members and gains a sixth only when two independent
consumers need it (FR-035), so this translation **projects onto what exists
and invents nothing**. pydantic-ai publishes twenty-odd event kinds; four
carry information a loom consumer can act on, and the rest are structural
(part boundaries, availability deltas, realtime-session signals).

Structural kinds are dropped rather than turned into an ``error``: an
``error`` terminates the stream (SC-011), so reporting one for a
``part_end`` would fail a healthy run. Drift is caught instead by a coverage
test that fails when pydantic-ai adds a kind this module has not been taught
— explicit, and at test time rather than in production.

Two translations carry a contract of their own.

``tool_result.summary`` is built by loom from the structured facts a loom
toolset publishes in ``metadata["loom"]``, and only from a closed list of
shapes (FR-030b). A tool result is model-influenced content: were the summary
read from the payload — or from a free-form string a tool supplied — a tool
could dictate what every SSE consumer displays, and a large payload would be
copied into every event. An unknown or absent shape degrades to ``"ok"``.

The ``refused`` shape is the one that also flips ``ok``: a tripped bound or a
contained failure must not read as a normal call in the stream. Its summary is
the fixed word ``"refused"`` — carrying the reason would put tool-authored text
back into the summary, which is exactly what FR-030b forbids.

``tool_call.arguments`` is a decoded mapping, decoded exactly once here. The
engine hands the raw argument string through unparsed when the model emits
malformed JSON — ``ToolCallPart.args_as_dict()`` answers
``{"INVALID_JSON": "<the raw string>"}`` rather than raising — so relaying it
would leak the model's unparsed text to every consumer as if it were
structured arguments. Malformed arguments therefore become ``{}``.

"""Output validation at the engine boundary — one decode, zero encodes.

pydantic-ai's ``output_schema`` instructs the model and returns a plain
dictionary **without runtime validation** (research R-004), so loom validates.
It does so with the decoder the compiler already built, over the model's raw
JSON bytes: :meth:`msgspec.json.Decoder.decode` fuses validation and
construction into a single pass, which is what invariant 5 requires.
``msgspec.convert()`` over a mapping is never used here — walking a second
object graph for the same payload is the double pass the performance rules
forbid.

**Where the bytes come from.** The engine keeps the provider's own payload in
the final ``ModelResponse``: the output tool call's ``args``, or the text part
for a text answer. For every provider whose wire format is JSON text — OpenAI
and Anthropic among them — ``args`` is still the untouched string the model
produced, and loom decodes exactly that.

pydantic-ai builds its own ``result.output`` for every provider, so it parses
that payload once on its side whatever the vendor. That pass is the engine's
and is outside loom's budget; loom's own budget — the one the contract suite
counts — is the single decode below.

**Declared residual** (invariant 5, "residual"): some provider SDKs parse the
tool arguments before pydantic-ai sees them (the Bedrock Converse API returns
``toolUse.input`` already decoded). For those, the raw string no longer
exists, and the engine's own ``ToolCallPart.args_as_json_str()`` re-serialises
it. That pass belongs to the engine and is not hidden: loom still performs
exactly one decode and no encode, and the residual is confined to the branch
below.

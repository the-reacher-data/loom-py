"""``InferenceTarget`` → pydantic-ai model and provider objects (R-002).

One model object is built per plan, at start-up, and reused by every run: the
provider client it carries owns the connection pool, so rebuilding it per
request would pay a new TLS handshake for every prompt.

Each provider is an island under :mod:`loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai.providers`:
the one module that imports its vendor SDK, at the top, and builds its model.
This module never imports a vendor SDK. It maps ``InferenceTarget.provider``
to the island and the extra that brings it, loads the island once the binding
names it — through :func:`~loom.ai.registry.require_provider_sdk`, the
engine's reading of :func:`loom.core.plugins.optional.import_optional` — and
lets the island do the rest. Adding a vendor is one island and one row here;
an unknown vendor fails at start-up naming the ones this release binds, and a
missing SDK fails naming the extra to install.

Credential conventions, deliberately explicit (FR-018), are each island's to
document: ``bedrock`` reads ``credentials_ref`` as an AWS profile name; the
API-key providers read it as the name of the environment variable holding the
key. ``options`` is handed to the model as pydantic-ai ``ModelSettings`` — the
engine's own vendor-settings vocabulary — so loom introduces no second
settings dialect of its own.

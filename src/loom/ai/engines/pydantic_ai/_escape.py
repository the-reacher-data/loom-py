"""The escape hatch: this engine's own objects, for what loom does not serve.

It lives in the engine package rather than in :mod:`loom.ai.abc` so that the
neutral surface keeps naming no engine: importing this module is the explicit
act of leaving loom's guarantees behind. What a run driven from here keeps and
loses is stated once, on :meth:`~loom.ai.abc.AgentHandle.native` — this module
carries the contract, not the reasoning.

    Attributes:
        agent: The agent built from this plan's spec, carrying the artefact's
            ``output_check`` validator when it declares one. Shared by every
            run of this plan for the life of the worker: handed over as it
            is, not copied, so mutating it changes every run of that agent
            in this worker, including the ones loom itself drives. Refuses a
            run-level ``output_type`` when it holds a validator (pydantic-ai's
            own ``UserError``); use :attr:`shaped_agent` for a run that
            overrides the output shape.
        shaped_agent: The same agent spec, built with no ``output_check``
            validator registered, for a run overriding the plan's declared
            output shape. Identical to :attr:`agent` — the very same object —
            whenever the plan declares no ``output_check``.
        deps: The dependency bundle of one caller, carrying their verified
            identity and this run's state. Every capability call made with it
            runs as that caller, which is what keeps a run driven from here
            inside the artefact's own grants.
        usage_limits: The artefact's spend caps, projected onto the engine's
            own type and copied for this call: mutating the returned value
            never changes what the engine enforces on its own, loom-supervised
            runs. Passing it on to a driven run is the caller's own choice.

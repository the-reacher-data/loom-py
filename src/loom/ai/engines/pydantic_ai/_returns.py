"""Tool return values, and the one metadata key a tool may not write.

One of the four invariants of a capability call holds here (US5):

* **Result bounds are applied before the model's context.** ``max_rows`` and
  ``max_result_bytes`` are checked on the way back; a tripped bound returns a
  refusal that names the bound and carries no row data (FR-046b). It returns
  rather than raises, so the model can narrow its own query.

The reserved ``loom`` metadata key is what
:mod:`~loom.ai.engines.pydantic_ai._events` builds an event summary from, so
it is stripped from every return loom did not author (FR-030b).

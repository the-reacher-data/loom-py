"""The capability call boundary: who runs a tool, and what may escape it.

Two of the four invariants of a capability call hold here (US5):

* **The call runs as the caller, or it does not run.** The dependency bundle
  must carry a verified :class:`~loom.core.identity.Identity` *and* the
  application container. A bundle carrying neither fails closed with
  ``UNAUTHORIZED``; it is never degraded to ``ANONYMOUS`` (FR-043, FR-045).
* **No raw application failure escapes a tool.** An authorisation denial is
  re-raised as ``UNAUTHORIZED`` — an ``AUTHORIZATION`` code the retry policy
  never replays — and every other failure is logged server-side and answered
  with a generic refusal value. Were it allowed to escape, the engine's
  classifier would read it as ``PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE``, the run would be
  replayed, and an already-successful mutating use case would run again.

Every guard lives **inside** a tool body, never at engine build: a
pure-language agent holds no capability, so its dependency bundle may
legitimately be ``None`` and building its engine must not require one.

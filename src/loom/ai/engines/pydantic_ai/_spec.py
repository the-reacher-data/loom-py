"""``AgentPlan`` → ``pydantic_ai.AgentSpec`` (native-inside).

The engine has a declarative form of its own, so the adapter translates into
it and lets ``Agent.from_spec()`` build the agent. Nothing here wraps an
engine primitive in a loom equivalent: the translation is a projection of the
plan's fields onto the engine's, and everything the plan carries that the
engine has no field for stays with loom.

What is deliberately **not** projected:

* ``metadata`` — ownership and cost-centre facts; never sent to a provider.
* ``model_role`` — a loom concept; the concrete model is bound separately
  (``_models``) and passed as an object, not as a ``provider:model`` string.
* ``run_timeout_ms`` / ``max_iterations`` — enforced by
  :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.AgentRuntime`, which supervises every stream; a
  second enforcement here would be a hidden, divergent limit.

"""Outbound MCP transport: this agent calling a remote tool server.

One ``MCPToolset`` per connection serves the whole worker, and
:class:`SharedMcpToolsets` is what holds them:

* :meth:`SharedMcpToolsets.open` is the
  :data:`~loom.ai.runtime.McpClientFactory` the runtime opens at start-up.
  Entering it connects the server and hands back a session, so an unreachable
  server fails start-up as ``MCP_SERVER_UNREACHABLE`` and the declared tool
  filters are validated against the tools the server really exposes (FR-025)
  instead of being taken on trust.
* :meth:`SharedMcpToolsets.toolset` is what the engine puts behind the
  capability boundary for the run itself — the *same object*, so the start-up
  connection is the run's connection and a worker holds one channel per server
  rather than one per agent (FR-026).

What is shared is the toolset, and :class:`_ToolsetSession` — what a grant
view (:meth:`~loom.ai.abc.AgentHandle.mcp`, a use case's ``Mcp()``) calls
through — declares itself with
:class:`~loom.ai.abc.ConcurrentMcpSession`, so the runtime leaves it
unwrapped too: it goes straight to the same reference-counted ``MCPToolset``
the model's own tool calls use, so a grant view's calls run concurrently with
the model's and with each other, never queued behind
:class:`~loom.ai.runtime.SharedMcpSession`'s single lock.

:func:`build_mcp_toolset` holds the connection rules of one grant — its
validated URL and its credential — once, so start-up cannot validate a server
the run would not reach.  The credential itself is resolved by
:mod:`loom.ai.remote_auth`, which is where the deployment's own strategy plugs in;
this module only carries the result to the client.

The MCP client ships as an optional ``pydantic-ai-slim`` dependency, so it is
imported inside the function that needs it: importing it at module load would
break every deployment that declares no ``mcp`` grant.

    Every agent granted a server works over the same ``MCPToolset`` instance,
    which is what makes a worker hold one channel per server instead of one
    per agent. ``MCPToolset`` reference-counts ``__aenter__``, so the runtime
    entering it at start-up and each run entering it again open a single
    session, and the connection closes when the last holder leaves.

    Sharing the toolset — rather than a
    :class:`~loom.ai.runtime.SharedMcpSession` over it — is what keeps the
    runs concurrent: the session wrapper serialises every call on one lock,
    so one agent's ``tool_timeout_ms`` would stop bounding anything for its
    neighbours, queued behind it. :class:`_ToolsetSession` holds no such
    lock, so a caller cancelled mid-call — the plan's own
    ``tool_timeout_ms`` firing, in particular — returns immediately instead
    of waiting for the call to drain; the underlying JSON-RPC client still
    matches every in-flight response to its own request id, so an abandoned
    call never desynchronises a neighbour sharing the connection.

    All of that holds only while the runtime's ``mcp_client_factory`` and the
    engine build read the *same* instance. :meth:`open` records every
    connection it was asked for and :meth:`for_build` refuses one it was never
    asked for, which is why the two are separate methods: a shared
    build-and-cache helper would have made :meth:`open` satisfy its own check
    and left the wiring unverified. The engine build runs strictly after the
    runtime opened its clients, so a grant missing from that record can only
    mean the runtime was handed some other factory — and the run would then
    hold a second connection whose tool filters nothing validated (FR-025).

    State is per instance and owned by the engine provider; nothing here is
    module-level. One instance serves one runtime lifecycle: the toolsets are
    never evicted, and an ``MCPToolset`` re-entered from a second event loop
    would reuse a lock bound to the first.

    This per-server deadline never fires first in production — see "The
    per-server handshake deadline never fires first" in ``docs/ai/mcp.md``.

    Every toolset built by an instance waits
    :data:`DEFAULT_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for its connection and
    ``initialize`` handshake unless :meth:`set_connect_timeout` replaces that
    deadline; production is handed the deployment's real
    ``ai.startup_timeout_ms`` that way.

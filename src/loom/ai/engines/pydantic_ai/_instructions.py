    """Compile a templated block once and return the closure that renders it.

    With a declared schema (``state.schema`` set), ``check_template_compatibility``
    runs first, straight against ``pydantic_handlebars`` — so a marker the
    schema does not declare fails here, at start-up, rather than silently
    rendering as the empty string (FR-032). Under the ``deps_type: dict``
    waiver, or when this artifact declares no state at all, there is no
    schema to check against and the template compiles bare (FR-033).
    Compilation happens once, in this function, never inside the returned
    closure — the closure only renders.

    ``pydantic_ai.TemplateStr`` is not used to reach ``pydantic_handlebars``
    here: its untyped render path, ``TemplateStr.render``, builds a fresh
    ``pydantic.TypeAdapter(type(deps))`` on every call — the trap that ruled
    out a typed compilation path for this pillar (spike, T001) — and would
    pay a ``dump_python`` round trip per block per request. This function
    calls ``pydantic_handlebars.compile``/``check_template_compatibility``
    directly and keeps the already-compiled template in the closure.

    The returned closure is ``async def``, not ``def``. On the route this
    module takes, a callable instruction is resolved by
    ``pydantic_ai._system_prompt.SystemPromptRunner.run``, whose synchronous
    branch awaits ``run_in_executor``: a plain ``def`` would pay a
    thread-pool hop per templated block per request for what is a
    synchronous string substitution. An ``async def`` closure skips that hop
    (NFR-002).

    The closure renders against ``ctx.deps.state``, never against ``ctx.deps``
    itself. ``ctx.deps`` is the bundle carrying the caller's verified
    ``Identity``, the application container and a caller-bound invoker
    (``loom.rest.fastapi.auto``); rendering against the bundle would put all
    three within a marker's reach. Rendering against ``state`` — the
    normalised mapping the artifact declared a shape for — is the security
    boundary a template cannot cross (FR-036).

    The returned closure carries no name the engine can address: on this
    route, a name is read only off an
    :class:`~pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart`
    (``pydantic_ai._instructions.sourced_instruction``), and
    ``InstructionPart.content`` is a plain ``str`` that cannot carry a
    template. The engine's decorator route, ``pydantic_ai.Agent.instructions``,
    does read a callable's declared name, but it appends every block it
    registers, which would push every templated block behind every literal
    one and destroy the authored order :func:`build_instructions` exists to
    keep. The missing name is the price of keeping that order — it is not a
    limit of the engine, which can name a callable on its own route
    (FR-026).

    Args:
        block: Compiled block; ``text`` is the Handlebars source.
        state: Artifact's declared state shape, or ``None``. Its ``schema``,
            when present, is what a marker is checked against; absent, the
            template compiles unchecked.
        component: Artifact name, for a compilation failure's message.
        label: This block's own name, or its position (FR-034).

    Returns:
        An ``async`` closure rendering the compiled template against the
        run's state.

    Raises:
        AgentCompilationError: The template fails to parse, or fails the

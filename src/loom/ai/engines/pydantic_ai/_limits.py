"""Spend caps projected onto the engine's own ``UsageLimits``.

``PolicySpec`` carries five caps (FR-040), four of them optional and one,
``max_requests``, always set to a default; :func:`usage_limits` projects all
five one-to-one onto :class:`pydantic_ai.usage.UsageLimits`, built once per
plan at engine construction and passed on every run. An absent optional cap
is ``None``, which the engine treats as "disable that limit".

See "Spend caps" in ``docs/ai/artifacts.md`` for why ``input_tokens_limit``
and ``output_tokens_limit`` are deliberately not projected, for how each
projected limit enforces (preemptive or after the fact), and for why a
model's cost can be permanently unpriceable.

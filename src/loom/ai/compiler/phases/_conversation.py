"""Conversation phase: resolve ``conversation.usecase`` and prove its Input is feedable.

The runtime offers the loader a fixed set of run-context names
(:data:`~loom.ai.compiler._plan.CONVERSATION_CONTEXT_FIELDS`) and the proof
is the one shared with the output hook
(:mod:`loom.ai.compiler.phases._feedable`), plus one rule of its own: the
Input must declare ``conversation_id``, or the loader cannot know which
conversation to load.  Nothing about the loader's return type is inspected;
the return value is checked at run time.

The model never sees the loader: it is not a tool and never reaches
``plan.capabilities``.  A key that is also a ``kind: usecase`` grant is
refused, because the model would then choose the ``conversation_id``.

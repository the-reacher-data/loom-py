"""Instructions phase: project the declared form onto one sequence of blocks.

:attr:`~loom.ai.declarative.AgentSpecV1.instructions` accepts a literal string
or a non-empty sequence of :class:`~loom.ai.declarative.InstructionBlock`.
:func:`compile_instructions` resolves both spellings to one
``tuple[CompiledInstruction, ...]``: a bare string becomes a single unnamed
literal block, so a string artifact and a one-block artifact compile to the
same plan shape and nothing downstream asks which of the two an artifact
declared.

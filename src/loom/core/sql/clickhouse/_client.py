# --- Multi-role transport workaround (pending upstream) ----------------------
#
# ClickHouse activates several roles only through REPEATED HTTP parameters
# ("role=a&role=b"); a comma-joined value is parsed as one role name and
# rejected with code 511. clickhouse-connect 0.15.1 builds the request URL in
# ``HttpClient._raw_request`` with ``urlencode(final_params)`` — without
# ``doseq=True`` — so a sequence value would be sent as its repr
# ("role=%5B%27a%27%2C+%27b%27%5D"), an invalid role name. Upstream ``main``
# still encodes it the same way, so this is not fixed by a version bump.
#
# Rebinding the encoder the driver looks up is the smallest correct seam:
# ``doseq=True`` produces byte-identical output for the ``str``/``int``/``bool``
# values the driver builds today and only changes sequences, whose current
# encoding is invalid anyway. Overriding ``_raw_request`` instead would mean
# duplicating ~80 lines of driver internals (retry loop, session guard, error
# handling) with no way to reuse the URL building alone.
#
# The rebinding is NOT applied at import: mutating a third-party namespace for
# the whole process — including consumers that never touch Loom — as a side
# effect of an import is exactly the hidden global state this framework
# forbids. The registry enables it explicitly, and only for a connection that
# can ever apply more than one role.
#
# ``supports_repeated_query_params`` re-checks the outcome so the registry can
# fail closed on a driver that stops exposing the seam, and
# ``tests/unit/core/sql/test_clickhouse_transport.py`` pins the patch point so
# the workaround can never degrade silently.

"""Caller-bound SQL execution: the roles come from the verified identity.

:class:`~loom.core.sql.service.SqlQueryService` takes the roles as an argument,
so the code that writes the call chooses them. That is the right shape for
system work with no caller, and the wrong one for work done *on behalf of* a
caller: within the connection allowlist, a use case could then query with roles
its caller does not hold.

This module gives that second case its own collaborator. It resolves the
effective roles through :func:`~loom.core.sql.roles.resolve_query_roles`, the
same function the agent capability and the REST endpoint use, and exposes no
way to pass roles in.

The identity it is handed must be declared with the
:func:`~loom.core.use_case.markers.Caller` marker, which the executor fills
from the identity the transport verified::

    async def execute(self, identity: Identity = Caller()) -> SqlQueryResult:

An ``identity`` parameter *without* that marker is a plain primitive parameter:
the compiler binds it from the ``params`` the calling code supplies, so it is
whatever that code says it is — forgeable, and, on the agent path, an argument
the model itself fills in. Binding the roles to a forged identity binds them to
nothing.

    """Executes SQL with the roles of the verified caller, and only those.

    Every query is bound to an :class:`~loom.core.identity.identity.Identity`:
    the effective roles are the intersection of the roles that identity holds
    with the connection allowlist. There is deliberately no ``roles``
    parameter — accepting one would reintroduce the very gap this collaborator
    closes, since the caller's entitlements would stop being what decides.

    **The identity must come from** :func:`~loom.core.use_case.markers.Caller`.
    That marker is the only thing that makes the executor inject the identity
    the transport verified. An ``identity`` parameter declared without it is an
    ordinary primitive parameter, bound from the ``params`` the calling code
    supplies: the caller would then choose its own identity, and with it the
    roles this class derives. On the agent path it is worse still, because
    those ``params`` are tool arguments the model writes. A query bound to a
    forged identity is unbound.

    A connection with an empty ``allowed_roles`` cannot be queried this way: its
    only role is the shared ``default_role``, which is not derived from anyone,
    so :class:`~loom.core.sql.abc.errors.RolesNotBoundError` is raised. Use
    :class:`~loom.core.sql.service.SqlQueryService` for that unbound work.

    Each accepted query opens one span labelled with the effective roles and
    the caller subject, the same audit trail the REST endpoint emits. Without
    an observability runtime there is no span and no other difference.

    Args:
        service: Underlying query service applying the connection policy.
        config: Parsed ``sql:`` section holding the per-connection allowlists.
        observability: Runtime the audit span is opened on. ``None`` disables
            the span; the auto-bootstrapped app injects the registered runtime.

"""SQL subsystem errors built on the existing domain error hierarchy.

Inheriting from the existing domain types keeps the HTTP mapping unchanged:
:class:`~loom.core.errors.NotFound` maps to 404,
:class:`~loom.core.errors.Forbidden` to 403 and
:class:`~loom.core.errors.RuleViolation` to 422 through the current
``HttpErrorMapper`` without touching the public error API.

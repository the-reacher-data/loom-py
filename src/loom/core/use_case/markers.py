    Once an MCP resolver is wired into the executor, it will resolve
    *server* against the MCP servers compiled for this deployment and
    inject an ``McpHandle`` bound to this execution's verified caller — the
    only way a use case is meant to reach an MCP server (constructor
    injection is not offered for this resource). No resolver is wired yet:
    a compiled use case that declares this marker fails fast with a
    ``RuntimeError`` at its first execution instead of receiving the raw
    marker object. Names in *include* are globs, and once resolution ships
    they will be matched by the same ``select_names``/``admits`` the model's
    own toolset filter uses; there is no ``exclude`` in this version because
    no caller has asked for one and a short allow-list already expresses
    every case on the table.

    Unlike :func:`Agent`, no output type is **ever** checked against the
    parameter's annotation: ``McpHandle`` carries no type parameter, so there
    is no declared shape to compare it with. Both checks a ``Mcp()`` marker
    gets are already wired at start-up, aborting the boot rather than waiting
    for a first call: *server* is validated against ``ai.mcp_servers``, naming
    the declaring use case and parameter when it is not configured, and
    *include* is checked against the server's real tool list under the same
    ``startup_timeout_ms`` an agent's own ``mcp`` filter is checked against.
    The second check needs a listing, so under
    ``ai.remote_clients: optional`` a server that never connected is skipped
    rather than failing: a tolerated outage means the filter goes unverified,
    not that it verified clean.

    Resolution is a separate thing and is **not** wired: the handle is never
    built or injected, which is why a compiled use case declaring this marker
    still hits the ``RuntimeError`` above at its first execution rather than
    receiving a live ``McpHandle``.

    Returned value is intentionally typed as ``Any`` to avoid ``mypy``
    default-argument incompatibility in signatures like:

    Args:
        server: Name of a configured MCP server, as declared under
            ``ai.mcp_servers``.
        include: Glob patterns naming the tools this handle may call.
            Keyword-only and required: everywhere this include/exclude
            shape is used, an empty ``include`` means "every name" — the
            filter only narrows when it carries at least one pattern — so an
            empty sequence here would
            silently grant the *entire server*, not the handful of tools the
            signature names. ``Mcp()`` raises ``ValueError`` instead of
            widening the grant behind the caller's back. A bare ``str`` is
            rejected the same way: ``str`` satisfies ``Sequence[str]``, so
            ``include="search"`` would type-check yet split into six
            single-character glob patterns at runtime.

    Raises:

    """Structural protocol for types that can be compiled and executed.

    Both :class:`~loom.core.use_case.use_case.UseCase` and
    :class:`~loom.core.job.job.Job` satisfy this protocol by duck typing.
    :class:`~loom.core.engine.executor.RuntimeExecutor` depends on this
    abstraction, not on either concrete class — satisfying OCP and DIP.

    The compiler inspects the class once at startup and stores an immutable
    :class:`~loom.core.engine.plan.ExecutionPlan`.  The executor drives
    execution purely from that plan; no per-request reflection occurs.

    Implementors must declare:

    - ``__execution_plan__``: populated by the compiler at startup.
    - ``computes``: transformations applied before rule checks.
    - ``rules``: validations applied after computes.
    - ``execute()``: core logic; may be ``async def`` or plain ``def``.
      The executor detects the kind via ``inspect.iscoroutinefunction``.

"""Post-commit channel: actions that run once a transaction has committed.

The executor binds one :class:`PostCommitChannel` per execution that owns a
unit of work (or when no channel is bound) and drains it after the commit.
Actions enqueued while a channel is bound belong to that channel; a
failed transaction discards them.  The owner unbinds the channel before
draining, so an execution started from an action opens its own lifecycle.

        The owner unbinds the channel before draining, so an execution
        started from an action opens its own lifecycle. A failing action
        does not stop the others, in either lane; their failures collect
        into one :class:`PostCommitError`.

        The two lanes carry different durability stories, so they are run
        differently:

        * A priority action (:meth:`enqueue_priority`) describes a write
          that has *already committed* — that is the whole point of
          deferring it here rather than running it inline. It runs under
          ``asyncio.shield``: a cancellation reaching this call cannot
          interrupt it, so it always completes even if the caller gives up
          on waiting. It is expected to be cheap (a handful of cache
          ``incr`` calls), which is what makes the shield safe to take
          unconditionally.
        * A plain action (:meth:`enqueue`) — a job dispatch — has its own
          durability story and no such requirement, so it stays exactly as
          interruptible as before the priority lane existed: a cancellation
          arriving while the plain lane runs stops the drain at once, and
          the plain actions not yet run stay queued so a later drain can run
          them. In inline job mode a dispatched job's body is awaited here
          as a full nested use-case execution
          (:class:`~loom.core.job.service._PendingDispatch.run`), with no
          framework-imposed timeout — shielding it, as the priority lane
          is shielded, would make it uncancellable for as long as it ran;
          this is why the two lanes are not shielded alike.

        Args:
            committed: Whether a transaction of this owner's had committed
                when the actions ran.  ``False`` when the owner held no unit
                of work, so a caller may safely retry the whole operation.

class RuntimeExecutor:

    Receives a fully constructed UseCase instance and drives execution
    through the fixed pipeline: bind params → build command → load entities
    → apply computes → check rules → call execute.

    Owns the execution lifecycle around that pipeline.  When a
    ``uow_factory`` is provided, each top-level execution opens a
    :class:`~loom.core.uow.abc.UnitOfWork` through its context-manager
    protocol and closes it the same way: commit on success, rollback on any
    exception, cancellation included.  Nested calls detected via a
    ``contextvars.ContextVar`` share the outer transaction and never open an
    additional UoW.  Post-commit actions (job dispatches) are queued on a
    :class:`~loom.core.engine.post_commit.PostCommitChannel` owned by the
    execution that owns the unit of work (or by the outermost execution when
    there is none) and run once the unit of work has closed.

    No signature inspection occurs at runtime. All structural information
    comes from the cached ExecutionPlan produced by UseCaseCompiler.

    Emits ``RuntimeEvent`` objects to the optional ``MetricsAdapter``:
    ``EXEC_START`` before the unit of work opens and exactly one terminal
    event, ``EXEC_DONE`` once the unit of work has committed and closed or
    ``EXEC_ERROR`` with the ``error_kind`` of the step that failed.
    Enriches log calls with structured fields (``usecase``,
    ``duration_ms``, ``status``) for structured log consumers.

    Args:
        compiler: Compiler used to retrieve cached plans.
        uow_factory: Optional UoW factory.  When provided, each top-level
            :meth:`execute` call is wrapped in a single atomic transaction.
            Nested executions within the same async context reuse the outer
            UoW.
        debug_execution: When ``True``, emits ``[STEP]`` logs for every
            pipeline stage. Defaults to ``False`` (summary logs only).
        logger: Optional logger. Defaults to the framework logger.
        metrics: Optional metrics adapter. When provided, receives
            ``EXEC_START``, ``EXEC_DONE``, and ``EXEC_ERROR`` events.
        repo_resolver: Optional callable that resolves a repository instance
            from an entity model type. Used by ``Load``/``Exists`` when
            ``dependencies`` override is not passed to :meth:`execute`.

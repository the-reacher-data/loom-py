"""Configuration loader backed by omegaConf.

omegaConf is the single source of truth for configuration.  It reads and
merges YAML files, resolves ``${oc.env:VAR}`` interpolations, and returns a
live :class:`omegaconf.DictConfig`.  The framework does **not** impose any
particular shape on the config — the user owns the structure.

For sections that benefit from strict typing, use :func:`section` to
extract and validate a subtree into a user-defined struct or dataclass via
``msgspec.convert``.

Cloud URIs
----------
:func:`load_config` accepts cloud storage URIs (``s3://``, ``gs://``,
``abfss://``, ``r2://`` …) in addition to local filesystem paths.  Cloud
files are fetched via ``fsspec`` at parse time, which means the config is
always resolved against the current state of object storage — no baking
into images or wheels.

Cloud files honour the ``includes`` directive exactly like local files:
relative entries resolve against the including URI, and entries may point
to any scheme.

Custom resolvers
----------------
Pass :class:`~loom.core.config.resolver.ConfigResolver` implementations to
resolve ``${prefix:key}`` placeholders at parse time::

    cfg = load_config("s3://bucket/prod.yaml", resolvers=[SsmResolver("eu-west-1")])

YAML ``includes`` directive
---------------------------
A config file may declare a top-level ``includes`` list to merge other
files before its own values.  Entries are resolved relative to the declaring
file, on any scheme, and may be globs (``*``, ``?``, ``[``); glob matches
are merged in lexicographic order of their resolved path.  The declaring
file always takes precedence over its includes.  Includes are resolved
recursively; circular references and entries matching no file raise
:class:`ConfigError`.

Example::

    # config/app.yaml
    includes:
      - base.yaml            # relative to config/
      - tables/*.yaml        # every YAML under config/tables/
      - s3://bucket/shared.yaml

    app:
      name: my-service  # overrides anything in base.yaml or secrets.yaml

Function-level composition is still available::

    cfg = load_config("config/base.yaml", "config/production.yaml")

Typed sections
--------------
:func:`section` binds a subtree to a user-defined type::

    class DatabaseConfig(msgspec.Struct, kw_only=True):
        url: str
        pool_size: int = 5

    db = section(cfg, "database", DatabaseConfig)

Keyed collections
-----------------
``keyed=`` names dotted paths whose mapping form merges by key across the
files of an ``includes`` composition.  A key declared by two files of the
same composition, or a list form mixed with a mapping form, raises
:class:`ConfigError` naming the files involved.  Explicit layers passed to
:func:`load_config` override keys as usual; only the form mismatch is
reported across them::

    cfg = load_config("config/app.yaml", keyed=("storage.tables",))

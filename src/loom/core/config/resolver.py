"""Pluggable config resolver protocol.

Resolvers extend the YAML loader with custom ``${prefix:key}`` interpolation,
enabling secret values to be fetched from external stores (e.g. AWS SSM,
Azure Key Vault) at parse time without ever writing them to disk.

Register resolvers via :func:`~loom.core.config.loader.load_config`::

    cfg = load_config("s3://bucket/prod.yaml", resolvers=[MyResolver()])

YAML placeholders::

    storage:
      catalogs:
        main:
          token: ${myresolver:prod/databricks/token}

The resolver name becomes the placeholder prefix.  Values are resolved
when OmegaConf materialises the config — i.e. at job startup, so secret
rotation takes effect on the next run without redeployment.

Built-in resolvers
------------------
:class:`~loom.core.config.ssm.SsmResolver` is the bundled implementation
for AWS SSM Parameter Store.  Install ``loom-kernel[config-ssm]`` to use it::

    from loom.core.config import load_config, SsmResolver

    cfg = load_config("config/prod.yaml", resolvers=[SsmResolver()])

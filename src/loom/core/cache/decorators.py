    Annotate the return type.  The wrapper derives a codec from it and applies
    it to the cached read and to the fresh one alike, so a hit and a miss
    return the same type; the supported grammar is a :class:`msgspec.Struct`,
    a scalar, or a ``list``, ``tuple`` or optional of those.  A return type
    outside it — a mapping, a generic container, ``Any``, a forward reference
    the defining module cannot resolve — emits a ``DeprecationWarning`` when
    the repository is wrapped, and keeps the old behaviour, where the cached
    call returns the decoded payload rather than the declared type.

    The declared type is what the caller gets, on the fresh call as on the
    cached one: a method annotated ``-> Stats`` that returns a subclass of
    ``Stats`` hands back a narrowed ``Stats``, and the fields the subclass
    added are dropped.  Declare the type you mean to return.

    A method that returns ``None`` is not cached: the backend cannot tell a
    stored ``None`` from a miss, so the read runs again next time.  A cached
    payload that no longer fits the declared type — an older deployment wrote
    it, and the type has since gained a field — is treated as a miss and
    overwritten, not raised to the caller.

    Treat the returned value as immutable.  Concurrent callers that miss
    together are served the *same object* by the coalesced load, while a
    caller served from the cache gets a freshly decoded one, so mutating a
    result makes the two paths disagree.  Return a struct, or a fresh copy.

    ``scope="entity"`` requires the model's primary key as the first
    positional argument (a keyword argument does not count); the wrapper
    raises ``TypeError`` otherwise, before touching the cache backend.  When
    the primary-key type resolves to a plain class the argument must be of
    that exact type — a ``datetime`` for a ``date`` key or a ``bool`` for an
    ``int`` key is rejected — while a key declared ``int | None`` resolves
    no class and gets no call-time validation.  A read keyed by any other
    field is a list-scoped read.

    Args:
        scope: ``"entity"`` for a single-entity read, ``"list"`` otherwise;
            decides which tags invalidate the entry and which TTL applies.
        ttl_key: Entity name whose TTL override applies, when the method
            caches something other than its own entity.

    Returns:
        The decorator that marks the method.

    The decorator only declares: it writes the policy on the function and
    returns the very same object, so the module imports with no configuration
    and the coroutine stays importable and unit-testable on its own. The
    composition root binds it later.

    The coroutine must be a **pure function of its arguments**: it may not read
    ambient identity — a contextvar tenant, a caller's credential — and may not
    hold a caller-scoped session. The key sees only the arguments, and the load
    is detached into its own task, so a coroutine that reads ambient state
    serves one caller's answer to another.

    A cached call is a TTL cache with no invalidation: unlike a repository read
    it carries no dependency tags, because loom cannot know what a coroutine
    depends on. It expires, or the caller bumps *version*.

    Args:
        ttl_key: Key whose ``ttl:`` override applies. It shares the namespace
            with entity TTLs, so a key equal to an entity name deliberately
            shares that entity's override.
        unless: Predicate over the result; truthy means the result is returned
            and nothing is stored. An empty answer from a rate-limited service

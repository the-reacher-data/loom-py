"""Result codecs for repository reads marked with ``@cache_query``.

A cached custom read has to answer with the same type whether the value came
from the repository or from the cache. The stored payload is builtins, so
without a codec the first call returns whatever the method built and every
later call returns the decoded payload — a struct on the miss, a ``dict`` on
the hit.

The codec is derived from the method's declared return annotation and applied
on both paths, so the two are indistinguishable and a value that does not
survive the round trip fails on the very first call. The supported grammar is
a :class:`msgspec.Struct`, a scalar, or a ``list``, ``tuple`` or optional of
those; ``tuple`` is restored as a tuple, which builtins conversion flattens
into a list. An annotation outside the grammar has no codec and the caller
falls back to :class:`PassthroughResultCodec`.

A coroutine marked with ``@cache_call`` uses the same machinery through
:func:`build_call_codec`, which extends the grammar with pydantic types behind
a lazily loaded adapter and refuses, rather than passes through, an annotation
it cannot describe.

The lenient builtins rendering every cache payload goes through lives here
too, because the pass-through codec is its main caller.

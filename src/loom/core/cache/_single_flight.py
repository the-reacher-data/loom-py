"""In-process coalescing of concurrent loads that share a cache key.

Internal to the cache layer. When a hot key misses, every concurrent request
for it misses at once and each one runs the same query; coalescing them turns
that burst into a single load whose result is handed to every caller.

The coordination is per process and per instance. A second process racing on
the same key costs one duplicate load, never a wrong answer, so no distributed
lock is involved.

A flight is detached from its callers, and nothing drains it at shutdown: a
loop closed while a load is still running logs "Task was destroyed but it is
pending". The load is a cache refill, so losing it costs nothing beyond that
line.

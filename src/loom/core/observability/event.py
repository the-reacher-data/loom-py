    appearing, with nothing to query. Each value names one of those endings and

    a trace says how the message ended.

        name: Human-readable label for the operation within the scope.
        kind: Lifecycle phase — ``START``, ``END``, or ``ERROR``.
        trace_id: Trace identifier for the current unit of work. Generated
            once per root span and propagated to all child spans.
        correlation_id: Business lineage identifier (saga, request, batch
            group). Always propagated from the upstream context.
        id: Optional stable identifier for the specific operation instance.
        duration_ms: Wall-clock duration in milliseconds. Set on ``END``
            and ``ERROR`` events only.
        status: Short outcome label. Set on ``END`` and exposed as a stable enum.
        error: Human-readable error description. Set on ``ERROR`` only.

            observer backends. Adapters use this to carry rich context
            (``flow``, ``node_idx``, ``run_id``, …) without coupling

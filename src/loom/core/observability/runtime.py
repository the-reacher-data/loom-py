"""ObservabilityRuntime — shared fan-out engine for all Loom modules.

The tracer factory is imported lazily from ``from_config``: it reaches the
OpenTelemetry SDK and OTLP exporters, which ship as extras only. Keeping that
import out of module scope is what lets ``loom.core.observability`` be imported
with nothing but ``opentelemetry-api`` installed.

Loom never calls ``set_tracer_provider``. The OTEL *context* is global, the
*provider* is not: a span from Loom's own provider therefore nests correctly
under a host span (logfire, an operator agent) and correctly parents the host
spans opened inside it, with each provider exporting only its own spans. That
is what lets Loom coexist with a host SDK without owning anything global.

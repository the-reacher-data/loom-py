"""Make the Loom message trace id the OTEL trace id, and build the sampler.

A streaming message must be traceable from ingestion, through every node, to
its death, under one trace id, continuous across services. The trace id that
satisfies that already exists: it arrives in a Kafka header, rides
``MessageMeta.trace_id`` through every node, survives error snapshots, and
crosses the Celery broker as a task kwarg.

There is no Tracer API for *"start a span in trace X"*, and fabricating a
parent ``SpanContext`` where no upstream span exists invents a parent edge to a
span that was never exported. The correct hook is the SDK's ``IdGenerator``:
``generate_trace_id`` is consulted **only for root spans**, so a span with a
real parent still inherits its parent's trace and only genuine roots adopt the
message id.

The whole module imports the OpenTelemetry **SDK**, which is extras-only, so it
must only ever be imported lazily from inside a function — see
:mod:`loom.core.observability.observer.otel`.

Ordering trap: ``TracerProvider.get_tracer`` snapshots ``id_generator`` into
the ``Tracer``. Assigning it afterwards is silently ignored. Install the
generator **before** acquiring any tracer. This is pinned by
``tests/contract/observability/test_otel_sdk_contract.py``.

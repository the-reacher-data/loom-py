"""Span handles for the observability runtime.

:meth:`~loom.core.observability.runtime.ObservabilityRuntime.span` covers the
common case: a span that opens and closes inside one lexical scope, and can
therefore be made *current* for its whole body.

:class:`LoomSpan` covers the case that cannot. A stream opens its span in one
``asend`` of an async generator and closes it in another, so the two ends run
in different :mod:`opentelemetry.context` contexts. A span made current in one
``asend`` would have to be detached in another — which raises internally, is
swallowed by OTEL as a *"Failed to detach context"* log line, and in between
frames leaks the span into whatever the consumer is doing. ``LoomSpan`` never
attaches, so neither can happen.

Only :class:`LoomSpan` is public here. ``SpanIdentity`` and
``apply_terminal_state`` are internal to the observability package.

    """Optional capability: report whether the caller owns the current session.

    A repository that resolves its session from the calling context — a
    ``@transactional`` scope, a unit of work — runs its reads inside a session
    that is closed when that caller unwinds, and whose uncommitted writes are
    visible only to it.  A wrapper that would otherwise detach a read from its
    caller must ask first: the cache layer skips its in-process coalescing
    while this returns ``True``, because a coalesced load outlives the caller
    that started it and would be shared with another one.

    A repository that does not implement this protocol is taken to own the
    scope of its own reads, which is what a repository opening and closing a
    session per call does.

    This capability is provisional: it exists because each backend publishes
    its transaction through its own ``ContextVar``.  It is expected to be
    replaced by the neutral transaction scope, and is not a stable extension
    point to build on.

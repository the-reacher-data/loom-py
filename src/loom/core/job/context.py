"""Pending job dispatches, delegated to the post-commit channel.

The public names are kept for existing callers; the queue itself is the
:class:`~loom.core.engine.post_commit.PostCommitChannel` bound by the
executor.  When no channel is bound, a per-context fallback channel holds
the dispatches so :func:`flush_pending_dispatches` and
:func:`clear_pending_dispatches` keep working for hand-driven callers.

Inside an execution the executor owns the drain: :func:`flush_pending_dispatches`
refuses to run then, and :func:`clear_pending_dispatches` discards the bound
channel rather than the fallback one.

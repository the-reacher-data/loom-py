"""Shared entry-point loader for Loom plugin groups.

This module is a stdlib-only leaf: it must never import from ``loom`` or from
any third-party package, so that ETL-only deployments can rely on it without
pulling optional dependencies into the process.

It centralises the plugin resolution policy used across pillars: duplicate
handling, missing-plugin reporting and the optional API-version handshake.

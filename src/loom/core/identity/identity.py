"""The authenticated caller of one execution, as a domain value object.

``Identity`` is deliberately transport-agnostic: it says *who* is calling and

produce the same shape, so business policies never learn what a token is.

    """Verified caller of a single execution.

    Instances are immutable and safe to share across an async context.  Only
    the transport layer builds them, from credentials it has already verified;
    every other layer consumes them read-only.

    Attributes:
        subject: Stable identifier of the caller.  Empty means anonymous.
        roles: Roles the caller holds, in the order the mechanism reported
            them and without duplicates.
        attributes: Verified string-valued facts about the caller (e-mail,
            tenant, department, ...).  Copied on construction, so a later
            mutation of the source mapping cannot rewrite the identity.
        mechanism: Label of the mechanism that authenticated the caller (e.g.
            ``"jwt"``).  Used for the audit trail, never for authorization.

"""Caller identity: the verified answer to "who is running this?".

Exposes the immutable :class:`Identity` value object, the explicit
:data:`ANONYMOUS` absence of one, and the context guard that propagates it
across the async stack.  This package belongs to the domain layer: it imports
no transport and no infrastructure.
